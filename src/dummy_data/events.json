This architecture demands a network fabric which not only supports massive scale and performance but also provides optimal load-balancing, low latency, congestion management and packet ordering capabilities. Unfortunately, the solutions available in the market to address this problem are proprietary and lack an open ecosystem to drive new standards and innovation.</p>\n<p>Ethernet is emerging as the medium of choice to build scale-out network fabrics for HPC and AI/ML workloads. In this keynote, we will discuss how the ubiquitous nature of Ethernet supported by a large, open ecosystem helps accelerate the pace of innovation while ensuring a standards-based implementation. We will explain how the open ecosystem is innovating to address the bandwidth, latency, load-balancing, and congestion management requirements for such deployments. </p>\n<p>We will introduce Broadcom’s latest contribution to OCP, a reference board design based on Broadcom’s latest silicon, which will be the foundational element for this fabric architecture. We will present these hardware and SAI contributions, working in conjunction with OEM, ODM, optics and NOS partners will become available as a solution for consumption of the broader Enterprise and Service Provider market. </p>\n<p>Moreover, we will illustrate with examples, how the network simplification achieved with this distributed architecture massively simplifies deployments allowing Hyperscalers, Service Providers and Enterprises to deploy this solution at scale. We will also highlight how this simplification significantly reduces power consumption in Datacenters hence reducing the carbon footprint. Finally, we will highlight how a broad base of suppliers, production volumes, and a highly competitive market environment, allows this Ethernet based architecture to offer economies of scale and lower equipment costs.</p>","social_description":"","start_date":1666113180,"end_date":1666114140,"summit_id":40,"class_name":"Presentation","allow_feedback":false,"avg_feedback_rate":0,"is_published":true,"published_date":1665604122,"head_count":0,"rsvp_link":null,"rsvp_template_id":0,"rsvp_max_user_number":0,"rsvp_max_user_wait_list_number":0,"rsvp_regular_count":0,"rsvp_wait_count":0,"rsvp_external":false,"meeting_url":"","attendance_count":0,"current_attendance_count":0,"image":null,"stream_thumbnail":null,"level":"N/A","created_by_id":27733,"updated_by_id":27691,"show_sponsors":false,"duration":960,"creator_id":27733,"moderator_speaker_id":0,"selection_plan_id":0,"problem_addressed":null,"attendees_expected_learnt":"","to_record":false,"attending_media":false,"status":"Accepted","progress":"COMPLETE","selection_status":"unaccepted","disclaimer_accepted_date":1659729852,"disclaimer_accepted":true,"custom_order":0,"attendee_votes_count":0,"rank":0,"sponsors":[],"tags":[],"feedback":[],"current_attendance":[],"type":{"id":497,"created":1648494509,"last_edited":1648494509,"name":"Keynote Presentation","class_name":"PresentationType","color":"#f0f0ee","black_out_times":false,"use_sponsors":true,"are_sponsors_mandatory":false,"allows_attachment":false,"allows_level":true,"allows_publishing_dates":true,"allows_location_timeframe_collision":true,"allows_location":true,"is_default":true,"summit_id":40,"max_speakers":3,"min_speakers":0,"max_moderators":0,"min_moderators":0,"use_speakers":true,"are_speakers_mandatory":true,"use_moderator":false,"is_moderator_mandatory":false,"moderator_label":"","should_be_available_on_cfp":false,"allow_custom_ordering":false,"allow_attendee_vote":false,"allows_speaker_event_collision":false,"summit_documents":[],"allowed_media_upload_types":[38]},"track":{"id":36070,"created":1650993953,"last_edited":1650993953,"name":"Keynote","description":"<ul>\n  <li>The ideal keynote speaker will be charismatic and draw participants in anticipation of their message or announcement. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>Keynote content should have broad relevance to the entire OCP ecosystem, including developers, adopters, users and business leaders from enterprise, financial services, manufacturing, retail and communications companies of all sizes. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>Consideration will be given to the announcement of contributions of new innovation and technology. &nbsp;&nbsp;All contributions discussed during a keynote must be fully executed and accepted by the IC committee beforehand. &nbsp;&nbsp;The OCP staff and IC committee can quarantine early specifications and collateral for release coincident with the keynote. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>Keynotes that highlight OCP technology and product adoption and speak to business and technical benefits will be given priority.&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>OCP was founded on the idea that a better cloud data center could be built and operated. &nbsp;Keynotes that address the challenges of GHG emissions, embodied carbon reduction, and water conservation in support of a sustainable future will be given priority. &nbsp;</li>\n</ul>","code":"KEY","slug":"keynote","session_count":20,"alternate_count":5,"lightning_count":0,"lightning_alternate_count":0,"voting_visible":false,"chair_visible":true,"summit_id":40,"color":"#f37991","icon_url":"https://object-storage.public.mtl1.vexxhost.net/swift/v1/6e4619c416ff4bd19e1c087f27a43eea/assets-fn/summit-track-icon/OCP22G-FNSIGN-Icon-GlobalSummit1.svg","order":13,"track_groups":[35],"allowed_tags":[],"extra_questions":[],"selection_lists":[555,556,612,685],"allowed_access_levels":[]},"location":{"id":325,"created":1651784375,"last_edited":1651784375,"name":"Grand Ballroom 220","short_name":null,"description":"<p>Grand Ballroom 220</p>","location_type":"Internal","order":3,"class_name":"SummitVenueRoom","capacity":2000,"override_blackouts":false,"venue":{"id":323,"created":1651784235,"last_edited":1651784235,"name":"SJCC","short_name":"San Jose McEnery Convention Center","description":"<p>The San Jose McEnery Convention Center sits in the center of Downtown and boasts hundreds of varied events a year.

a New Era of Computing Resilience - presented by Microsoft","description":"<p>Recent publications, speakers, and panels have highlighted a reemerging challenge in the age of hyperscale cloud computing: silent data corruption (SDC).  With modern life ever more dependent on the cloud, the consequences of corrupted data can be dire.  But, while the recent interest in SDC is new, the problem is certainly not: Silicon architects have defended against SDC in their designs for decades.  The difference today is the unprecedented <em>scale </em>of the cloud, from the workloads being run to the components that run them to the power consumed.  All that s<em>cale</em> combines to drives a desperate need to improve server resilience by all means available.  This expo talk will explore the challenge of taming SDC at-scale in more depth, including why Microsoft has joined with major industry and academic partners to found a new Server Component Resilience Workstream within the Open

Such changes are prone to disruptions either due to misconfiguration or network overloading.  SONiC, an open source NOS based on Linux, enables virtualizing of these topologies providing a low risk framework to network change validation, testing new features & running what-if analysis before production roll out.

The University embarked on the Open Networking journey in 2020 with <strong>OCP Accepted Open HW</strong> from Edge-Core and open-source network operating system, <strong>SONiC</strong> in their Data Centre. With the success of this deployment, FHTW decided to take the next step and replace their <strong>Campus core and edge </strong>switching from traditional OEM based solution to OCP Accepted Open HW and SONiC.

Presenters from FHTW and <strong>Broadcom</strong> will also talk about University’s new Campus Core and Edge Architecture, role of network automation, FHTW’s approach to secure access control & monitoring and how Broadcom’s contributions to <strong>SONiC</strong> and <strong>SAI</strong> enabled this.</p>","social_description":"","start_date":1666304400,"end_date":1666305600,"summit_id":40,"class_name":"Presentation","allow_feedback":false,"avg_feedback_rate":0,"is_published":true,"published_date":1665428366,"head_count":0,"rsvp_link":null,"rsvp_template_id":0,"rsvp_max_user_number":0,"rsvp_max_user_wait_list_number":0,"rsvp_regular_count":0,"rsvp_wait_count":0,"rsvp_external":false,"meeting_url":"","attendance_count":0,"current_attendance_count":0,"image":null,"stream_thumbnail":null,"level":"Intermediate","created_by_id":31001,"updated_by_id":27731,"show_sponsors":false,"duration":1200,"creator_id":31001,"moderator_speaker_id":0,"selection_plan_id":23,"problem_addressed":null,"attendees_expected_learnt":"<p>Attendees would learn about:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Why</strong> FHTW adopted Open Networking</li>\n  <li><strong>Benefits</strong> of adopting VXLAN EVPN based Campus Architecture</li>\n  <li>Secure access control design with <strong>Dot1x</strong>, <strong>MAB</strong> and Free Radius</li>\n  <li>FHTW’s approach to <strong>Network modelling</strong> and <strong>simulation</strong></li>\n  <li><strong>Operationalising</strong> and <strong>managing</strong> a large Open Networking based Campus Network</li>\n</ul>","to_record":false,"attending_media":false,"status":"Accepted","progress":"COMPLETE","selection_status":"accepted","disclaimer_accepted_date":1655482204,"disclaimer_accepted":true,"custom_order":0,"attendee_votes_count":0,"rank":9,"sponsors":[],"tags":[],"feedback":[],"current_attendance":[],"type":{"id":496,"created":1648494509,"last_edited":1648494509,"name":"Presentation","class_name":"PresentationType","color":"#f0f0ee","black_out_times":false,"use_sponsors":true,"are_sponsors_mandatory":false,"allows_attachment":false,"allows_level":true,"allows_publishing_dates":true,"allows_location_timeframe_collision":true,"allows_location":true,"is_default":true,"summit_id":40,"max_speakers":3,"min_speakers":1,"max_moderators":0,"min_moderators":0,"use_speakers":true,"are_speakers_mandatory":true,"use_moderator":false,"is_moderator_mandatory":false,"moderator_label":"","should_be_available_on_cfp":false,"allow_custom_ordering":false,"allow_attendee_vote":false,"allows_speaker_event_collision":false,"summit_documents":[],"allowed_media_upload_types":[35,41]},"track":{"id":36062,"created":1650993486,"last_edited":1650993486,"name":"EW: Networking","description":"<p>Networking hardware and software deployed into data centers, telecom central offices and enterprise.

The workstream is tasked to create oscillator classes targeting different use cases typically found in a data center, with the goal of simplifying oscillator selection for a desired level of PTP performance. This talk presents recent work to classify oscillator requirements, including test methods for those requirements and future challenges. The impact of oscillator noise on PTP time error is discussed to understand those factors that tend to dominate across oscillator classes. If you design or purchase oscillators for synchronizing traffic in data centers, attend to learn how OCP-TAP can help support your work.</p>","social_description":"","start_date":1666294200,"end_date":1666295400,"summit_id":40,"class_name":"Presentation","allow_feedback":false,"avg_feedback_rate":0,"is_published":true,"published_date":1662646273,"head_count":0,"rsvp_link":null,"rsvp_template_id":0,"rsvp_max_user_number":0,"rsvp_max_user_wait_list_number":0,"rsvp_regular_count":0,"rsvp_wait_count":0,"rsvp_external":false,"meeting_url":"","attendance_count":0,"current_attendance_count":0,"image":null,"stream_thumbnail":null,"level":"Intermediate","created_by_id":28072,"updated_by_id":28072,"show_sponsors":false,"duration":1200,"creator_id":28072,"moderator_speaker_id":0,"selection_plan_id":23,"problem_addressed":null,"attendees_expected_learnt":"<p>- Recent on goings of the Oscillator Workstream</p>\n<p>- Oscillator requirements for different nodes synchronizing data in a data center</p>\n<p>- Test method framework for verifying compliance to class requirements</p>\n<p>- How to participate in future work of Oscillator Workstream</p>\n<p><br /></p>","to_record":false,"attending_media":true,"status":"Accepted","progress":"COMPLETE","selection_status":"accepted","disclaimer_accepted_date":1658267345,"disclaimer_accepted":true,"custom_order":0,"attendee_votes_count":0,"rank":8,"sponsors":[],"tags":[],"feedback":[],"current_attendance":[],"type":{"id":496,"created":1648494509,"last_edited":1648494509,"name":"Presentation","class_name":"PresentationType","color":"#f0f0ee","black_out_times":false,"use_sponsors":true,"are_sponsors_mandatory":false,"allows_attachment":false,"allows_level":true,"allows_publishing_dates":true,"allows_location_timeframe_collision":true,"allows_location":true,"is_default":true,"summit_id":40,"max_speakers":3,"min_speakers":1,"max_moderators":0,"min_moderators":0,"use_speakers":true,"are_speakers_mandatory":true,"use_moderator":false,"is_moderator_mandatory":false,"moderator_label":"","should_be_available_on_cfp":false,"allow_custom_ordering":false,"allow_attendee_vote":false,"allows_speaker_event_collision":false,"summit_documents":[],"allowed_media_upload_types":[35,41]},"track":{"id":36069,"created":1650993769,"last_edited":1650993769,"name":"EW: Time Appliances Project (TAP)","description":"<p>Aims to bring together the community of datacenter operators, application developers, and equipment and semiconductor companies together to enable datacenter time-sensitive applications.</p>","code":"EW12","slug":"ew-time-appliances-project-tap","session_count":10,"alternate_count":2,"lightning_count":0,"lightning_alternate_count":0,"voting_visible":false,"chair_visible":true,"summit_id":40,"color":"#df796d","icon_url":"https://object-storage.public.mtl1.vexxhost.net/swift/v1/6e4619c416ff4bd19e1c087f27a43eea/assets-fn/summit-track-icon/OCP22G-FNSIGN-Icon-TAP.svg","order":12,"track_groups":[34],"allowed_tags":[],"extra_questions":[],"selection_lists":[613,737,738],"allowed_access_levels":[]},"location":{"id":329,"created":1651858082,"last_edited":1651858082,"name":"210AE","short_name":null,"description":"<p>210AE</p>","location_type":"Internal","order":7,"class_name":"SummitVenueRoom","capacity":300,"override_blackouts":false,"venue":{"id":323,"created":1651784235,"last_edited":1651784235,"name":"SJCC","short_name":"San Jose McEnery Convention Center","description":"<p>The San Jose McEnery Convention Center sits in the center of Downtown and boasts hundreds of varied events a year.

Examples include gaming, AR/VR/xR, conference calls, transaction tracking (banking), industrial synchronization and telecommunications (O-RAN). Traditional solutions for time and frequency synchronization include Synchronous Ethernet, IEEE1588, GPS and TCXO or even atomic clock solutions. We present a novel solution that extracts time and frequency information from nearby LTE or 5G 3GPP networks.

While these workloads require more memory, workloads running on another server have unutilized (stranded) memory. With rising DRAM costs and DRAM accounting for a large percentage of server costs, increasing memory requirements and stranded memory will drive higher costs into data centers. In this presentation, we will describe how memory pooling with Compute Express Link™ will help address these challenges to efficiently utilize the deployed DRAM in a data center. We will compare memory pooling architectures enabled by the CXL™ 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 specifications. We will briefly explore the ongoing collaborations within ecosystem and share insights for community feedback and continued collaboration to develop new OCP specifications and form-factors for memory pooling.</p>","social_description":"Memory pooling and emerging architectures for efficient memory utilization using CXL™","start_date":1666280400,"end_date":1666281900,"summit_id":40,"class_name":"Presentation","allow_feedback":false,"avg_feedback_rate":0,"is_published":true,"published_date":1665431642,"head_count":0,"rsvp_link":null,"rsvp_template_id":0,"rsvp_max_user_number":0,"rsvp_max_user_wait_list_number":0,"rsvp_regular_count":0,"rsvp_wait_count":0,"rsvp_external":false,"meeting_url":"","attendance_count":0,"current_attendance_count":0,"image":null,"stream_thumbnail":null,"level":"Intermediate","created_by_id":77968,"updated_by_id":27731,"show_sponsors":false,"duration":1500,"creator_id":77968,"moderator_speaker_id":0,"selection_plan_id":0,"problem_addressed":null,"attendees_expected_learnt":"<p>Attendees will learn about Compute Express Link ™ 1.1, 2.0 and 3.0 specifications, including the relevant features required to deploy memory expansion and memory pooling solutions.

In this talk, we’ll share our experiences on how we leveraged similar principles to build testing frameworks for optics and phys.  </p>\n<p>We carry forward our principle of minimal dependency testing to these tests and keep them contained to a single FBOSS device. We show how this approach can be further extended to testing L2 functionality like MACSEC, integration testing b/w various FBOSS components, warm boot testing and more. This framework is already in use inside Meta for developing new features, onboarding new platforms and regression testing biweekly SW releases to the entire FBOSS fleet.

The BootROM uses a Silicon Identity key, a Unique Device Secret (UDS), and a cryptographic digest of the FMC and life cycle fuses to generate and issue a certificate for the FMC’s Compounded Identity (CompID). Critically, the CompID certificate captures the measurement of the FMC operating environment such that the FMC cannot spoof it despite firmware layers serving as the attester.</p>\n<p>Instead of implementing a RIoT L0 to BootROM, we use a novel templated certificate approach along with hardware cryptographic accelerators and keystore to generate X.509-compliant certificates with minimal code footprint and inputs.

There is a need for a benchmark suite that represents the real-life workloads to drive application performance metrics for these servers.

The OSU Micro Benchmarks (OMB) are a widely used suite of benchmarks for measuring and evaluating the performance of MPI operations for point-to-point, multi-pair, and collective communications. These benchmarks are often used for comparing different MPI implementations and the underlying network interconnect.

Already, Cloud SPs, especially the hyperscale DC operators, are approximately two speed upgrade cycles (currently 400 G) and two generations of merchant silicon (25.6 Tbps) ahead of the rest of market. However, the migration path towards 400 Gbps and higher speed is different for each hyperscaler. Various choices in terms of chip generation and switch implementation are being made. Additionally, the path to 800 G and higher speed poses many challenges such as power consumption, which may cause delay in the adoption of these high speeds by certain hyperscalers. Optics are at the center of the power issue, and are estimated to comprise more than 50% of the power consumption at a system level when moving to 51.2 Tbps chips. Future data center networks may require a combination of photonic innovation (such as co-packaged optics) and optimized network architecture. This presentation provides an overview of the different choices made by various hyperscalers and their timeline of speed adoption. It also discusses some of the challenges and potential solutions.</p>","social_description":"","start_date":1666208100,"end_date":1666208700,"summit_id":40,"class_name":"Presentation","allow_feedback":false,"avg_feedback_rate":0,"is_published":true,"published_date":1661777815,"head_count":0,"rsvp_link":null,"rsvp_template_id":0,"rsvp_max_user_number":0,"rsvp_max_user_wait_list_number":0,"rsvp_regular_count":0,"rsvp_wait_count":0,"rsvp_external":false,"meeting_url":"","attendance_count":0,"current_attendance_count":0,"image":null,"stream_thumbnail":null,"level":"Intermediate","created_by_id":78253,"updated_by_id":27731,"show_sponsors":false,"duration":600,"creator_id":78253,"moderator_speaker_id":0,"selection_plan_id":23,"problem_addressed":null,"attendees_expected_learnt":"","to_record":false,"attending_media":false,"status":"Accepted","progress":"COMPLETE","selection_status":"accepted","disclaimer_accepted_date":1658270757,"disclaimer_accepted":true,"custom_order":0,"attendee_votes_count":0,"rank":5,"sponsors":[],"tags":[],"feedback":[],"current_attendance":[],"type":{"id":496,"created":1648494509,"last_edited":1648494509,"name":"Presentation","class_name":"PresentationType","color":"#f0f0ee","black_out_times":false,"use_sponsors":true,"are_sponsors_mandatory":false,"allows_attachment":false,"allows_level":true,"allows_publishing_dates":true,"allows_location_timeframe_collision":true,"allows_location":true,"is_default":true,"summit_id":40,"max_speakers":3,"min_speakers":1,"max_moderators":0,"min_moderators":0,"use_speakers":true,"are_speakers_mandatory":true,"use_moderator":false,"is_moderator_mandatory":false,"moderator_label":"","should_be_available_on_cfp":false,"allow_custom_ordering":false,"allow_attendee_vote":false,"allows_speaker_event_collision":false,"summit_documents":[],"allowed_media_upload_types":[35,41]},"track":{"id":36072,"created":1650994146,"last_edited":1650994146,"name":"Special Focus: Optics","description":"<p>This track will explore opportunities for collaboration between organizations adjacent to OCP working on optical networking (researchers and their vendors).

In this paper, different advanced packaging technology platforms have been developed for chiplets integration in HPC applications. Various high density FOCoS (Fan Out Chip on Substrate) platforms e.g., FOCoS chip first (FOCoS-CF), FOCoS chip last (FOCoS-CL) and FOCoS-Bridge ( FOCoS-B) will be introduced.

However, if this leads to an increase in server deployment times this can more than offset any benefits. Emerging deployment considerations such as immersion cooling bring a new set of tradeoffs.  Optics to the machine is potentially beneficial in decoupling  the number of machines per tank from the switch radix.  In the longer term improvements in  cooling may improve optical device reliability addressing some of the concerns about co packaged optics.</p>","social_description":"","start_date":1666209600,"end_date":1666210500,"summit_id":40,"class_name":"Presentation","allow_feedback":false,"avg_feedback_rate":0,"is_published":true,"published_date":1663711095,"head_count":0,"rsvp_link":null,"rsvp_template_id":0,"rsvp_max_user_number":0,"rsvp_max_user_wait_list_number":0,"rsvp_regular_count":0,"rsvp_wait_count":0,"rsvp_external":false,"meeting_url":"","attendance_count":0,"current_attendance_count":0,"image":null,"stream_thumbnail":null,"level":"Beginner","created_by_id":27731,"updated_by_id":85217,"show_sponsors":false,"duration":900,"creator_id":27731,"moderator_speaker_id":0,"selection_plan_id":23,"problem_addressed":null,"attendees_expected_learnt":"<p>A cloud provider perspective on future uses for optical interconnects</p>","to_record":false,"attending_media":false,"status":"Accepted","progress":"COMPLETE","selection_status":"unaccepted","disclaimer_accepted_date":1664829211,"disclaimer_accepted":true,"custom_order":0,"attendee_votes_count":0,"rank":0,"sponsors":[],"tags":[],"feedback":[],"current_attendance":[],"type":{"id":496,"created":1648494509,"last_edited":1648494509,"name":"Presentation","class_name":"PresentationType","color":"#f0f0ee","black_out_times":false,"use_sponsors":true,"are_sponsors_mandatory":false,"allows_attachment":false,"allows_level":true,"allows_publishing_dates":true,"allows_location_timeframe_collision":true,"allows_location":true,"is_default":true,"summit_id":40,"max_speakers":3,"min_speakers":1,"max_moderators":0,"min_moderators":0,"use_speakers":true,"are_speakers_mandatory":true,"use_moderator":false,"is_moderator_mandatory":false,"moderator_label":"","should_be_available_on_cfp":false,"allow_custom_ordering":false,"allow_attendee_vote":false,"allows_speaker_event_collision":false,"summit_documents":[],"allowed_media_upload_types":[35,41]},"track":{"id":36072,"created":1650994146,"last_edited":1650994146,"name":"Special Focus: Optics","description":"<p>This track will explore opportunities for collaboration between organizations adjacent to OCP working on optical networking (researchers and their vendors).

Previous work has shown the potential of intra rack-only resource disaggregation in HPC, but it is not clear how to realize these gains and cost-effectively meet the stringent bandwidth and latency requirements of HPC applications. To that end, we evaluate hardware implementations of intra-rack resource disaggregation based on emerging photonic components combined with the high escape bandwidth of modern multi chip modules (MCMs). We show that the increased latency due to disaggregation using emerging photonics results in a 13% application slowdown across 31 CPU benchmarks and 8% across 27 GPU benchmarks. However, we also show that using commercially available photonic switches, we can design an iso-throughput disaggregated HPC system that requires 4× fewer memory modules and 2× fewer NIC modules.</p>","social_description":"","start_date":1666211400,"end_date":1666212300,"summit_id":40,"class_name":"Presentation","allow_feedback":false,"avg_feedback_rate":0,"is_published":true,"published_date":1658507646,"head_count":0,"rsvp_link":null,"rsvp_template_id":0,"rsvp_max_user_number":0,"rsvp_max_user_wait_list_number":0,"rsvp_regular_count":0,"rsvp_wait_count":0,"rsvp_external":false,"meeting_url":"","attendance_count":0,"current_attendance_count":0,"image":null,"stream_thumbnail":null,"level":"Intermediate","created_by_id":78253,"updated_by_id":79756,"show_sponsors":false,"duration":900,"creator_id":78253,"moderator_speaker_id":0,"selection_plan_id":23,"problem_addressed":null,"attendees_expected_learnt":"<p>How emerging photonics can enable an efficient solution for fine-grain allocation of resources in order to reduce stranded (idling) resources.

The increase in power usage and the high operating temperatures of high-density environments require robust thermal management solutions that optimize operating and capital efficiency. In this conversational panel session, a leader from Santa Clara-based colocation provider Colovore will share their challenge to find a thermal management solution that could efficiently support their high- density rack environment in a space-saving design, and ended up with a PUE of 1.1 at 50% load. A thermal expert from Vertiv will provide insights into Vertiv’s liquid cooling rear-door heat exchanger solution led Colovore to operating efficiencies, scalability, and the ability to handle elevated heat loads in their high-density environment. A member of the Open Compute Project Foundation will provide their perspective on similar technologies currently being discussed and reviewed in the Foundation’s Cooling Environments Project.</p>","social_description":"","start_date":1666212300,"end_date":1666215000,"summit_id":40,"class_name":"Presentation","allow_feedback":false,"avg_feedback_rate":0,"is_published":true,"published_date":1660674555,"head_count":0,"rsvp_link":null,"rsvp_template_id":0,"rsvp_max_user_number":0,"rsvp_max_user_wait_list_number":0,"rsvp_regular_count":0,"rsvp_wait_count":0,"rsvp_external":false,"meeting_url":"","attendance_count":0,"current_attendance_count":0,"image":null,"stream_thumbnail":null,"level":"Intermediate","created_by_id":28053,"updated_by_id":27731,"show_sponsors":false,"duration":2700,"creator_id":28053,"moderator_speaker_id":0,"selection_plan_id":23,"problem_addressed":null,"attendees_expected_learnt":"","to_record":false,"attending_media":true,"status":"Accepted","progress":"COMPLETE","selection_status":"accepted","disclaimer_accepted_date":1658150894,"disclaimer_accepted":true,"custom_order":0,"attendee_votes_count":0,"rank":6,"sponsors":[],"tags":[],"feedback":[],"current_attendance":[],"type":{"id":498,"created":1648494509,"last_edited":1648494509,"name":"Panel","class_name":"PresentationType","color":"#f0f0ee","black_out_times":false,"use_sponsors":true,"are_sponsors_mandatory":false,"allows_attachment":false,"allows_level":true,"allows_publishing_dates":true,"allows_location_timeframe_collision":true,"allows_location":true,"is_default":true,"summit_id":40,"max_speakers":5,"min_speakers":1,"max_moderators":0,"min_moderators":0,"use_speakers":true,"are_speakers_mandatory":true,"use_moderator":false,"is_moderator_mandatory":false,"moderator_label":"","should_be_available_on_cfp":false,"allow_custom_ordering":true,"allow_attendee_vote":false,"allows_speaker_event_collision":false,"summit_documents":[],"allowed_media_upload_types":[35,41]},"track":{"id":36071,"created":1650994098,"last_edited":1650994098,"name":"OCP Adopters:  IT Ecosystem","description":"<p>In this track we will share the impact of OCP in the market including overall revenue, vertical and segment growth across regions.

Currently, we are collaborating with SK Telecom to enhance their in-house real-time data management system, LightningDB, by integrating CMS into their system. Our experiment results demonstrate that CMS-applied LigntningDB can achieve 69 % and 46% improvement in performance and power efficiency when running K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.</p>","social_description":"","start_date":1666213200,"end_date":1666214100,"summit_id":40,"class_name":"Presentation","allow_feedback":false,"avg_feedback_rate":0,"is_published":true,"published_date":1664462666,"head_count":0,"rsvp_link":null,"rsvp_template_id":0,"rsvp_max_user_number":0,"rsvp_max_user_wait_list_number":0,"rsvp_regular_count":0,"rsvp_wait_count":0,"rsvp_external":false,"meeting_url":"","attendance_count":0,"current_attendance_count":0,"image":null,"stream_thumbnail":null,"level":"Advanced","created_by_id":78288,"updated_by_id":27731,"show_sponsors":false,"duration":900,"creator_id":78288,"moderator_speaker_id":0,"selection_plan_id":22,"problem_addressed":null,"attendees_expected_learnt":"<p> In this presentation, we will introduce SK hynix's upcoming CXL-based memory solutions and present their practical use cases, focusing on data analytics applications.

In fact, chip and underlying power densities are growing even faster than expected. So is the heat from next-generation compute. Immersion cooling is a more efficient alternative to conventional thermal management methods (e.g., air cooling), but there are still questions around how the technology will scale to meet future demands. The Lubrizol® Corporation, a Berkshire-Hathaway-owned specialty chemical company, wants to answer them and we designed CompuZol™, our line of high-performing immersion fluids, as a first step to doing just that. Delivering unparalleled heat transfer, material compatibility and reliability/durability is just the beginning. CompuZol also pushes the boundaries of existing immersion fluid performance through built-in antistatic technology and a resilient global supply chain, ensuring the market’s needs are exceeded when and where needed.

Some of the challenges in proliferating liquid cooling across the industry are safety and reliability concerns with water-based fluids used in liquid cooled servers, which may cause electrical short and damage to the equipment if it leaks. Because of this, there is high demand for a leak detection and mitigation system to monitor the health of liquid cooled servers. This presentation is devised to share learnings from server level leak detection and mitigation DoE performed at Intel. Conventional leak sensors are integrated into liquid cooled system to monitor fluid leak and take proactive measures to mitigate and protect the IT equipment.

The research carefully combines these ideas to improve datacenter sustainability and efficiency, and starts by incubating these ideas into a university-scale prototype.</p>","to_record":false,"attending_media":true,"status":"Accepted","progress":"COMPLETE","selection_status":"unaccepted","disclaimer_accepted_date":1656719277,"disclaimer_accepted":true,"custom_order":0,"attendee_votes_count":0,"rank":0,"sponsors":[],"tags":[],"feedback":[],"current_attendance":[],"type":{"id":502,"created":1648495439,"last_edited":1648495439,"name":"Symposium Poster & Presentation","class_name":"PresentationType","color":"#f0f0ee","black_out_times":false,"use_sponsors":false,"are_sponsors_mandatory":false,"allows_attachment":false,"allows_level":true,"allows_publishing_dates":true,"allows_location_timeframe_collision":false,"allows_location":true,"is_default":false,"summit_id":40,"max_speakers":5,"min_speakers":1,"max_moderators":0,"min_moderators":0,"use_speakers":true,"are_speakers_mandatory":true,"use_moderator":false,"is_moderator_mandatory":false,"moderator_label":"","should_be_available_on_cfp":false,"allow_custom_ordering":false,"allow_attendee_vote":false,"allows_speaker_event_collision":false,"summit_documents":[30],"allowed_media_upload_types":[34,36,37]},"track":{"id":36093,"created":1654907427,"last_edited":1654907427,"name":"Future Technologies Symposium","description":"<p>Future Technologies Symposium - all Categories</p>","code":"FTS","slug":"future-technologies-symposium","session_count":40,"alternate_count":10,"lightning_count":0,"lightning_alternate_count":0,"voting_visible":false,"chair_visible":true,"summit_id":40,"color":"#8cb3d0","icon_url":"https://object-storage.public.mtl1.vexxhost.net/swift/v1/6e4619c416ff4bd19e1c087f27a43eea/assets-fn/summit-track-icon/OCP22G-FNSIGN-Icon-FT-Symp.svg","order":27,"track_groups":[33],"allowed_tags":[],"extra_questions":[],"selection_lists":[774,775,776,778],"allowed_access_levels":[]},"location":{"id":334,"created":1651859800,"last_edited":1651859800,"name":"LL20BC","short_name":null,"description":"<p>LL20BC</p>","location_type":"Internal","order":12,"class_name":"SummitVenueRoom","capacity":200,"override_blackouts":false,"venue":{"id":323,"created":1651784235,"last_edited":1651784235,"name":"SJCC","short_name":"San Jose McEnery Convention Center","description":"<p>The San Jose McEnery Convention Center sits in the center of Downtown and boasts hundreds of varied events a year.

This translates into the need for upgrading the capacity of existing data centers, as well as building new ones, with a trend towards dissipating significantly larger heat densities. Herein, the technology proposed here uses a novel thermosyphon architecture to passively dissipate the heat generated by the IT components and reject it to the facility cooling loop. The thermal performance data are discussed, along with the economic benefits for brownfield and greenfield deployments. The results show that passive direct-to-chip cold plate approach is a long-term solution, as it allows to increase reliability, reduce energy consumption, and lower noise level. Furthermore, it is critical to develop open standards and collaboration across ecosystems, driven by new cooling and heat reuse requirements, to ensure a broad market adoption.</p>","social_description":"","start_date":1666199400,"end_date":1666200300,"summit_id":40,"class_name":"Presentation","allow_feedback":false,"avg_feedback_rate":0,"is_published":true,"published_date":1664891828,"head_count":0,"rsvp_link":null,"rsvp_template_id":0,"rsvp_max_user_number":0,"rsvp_max_user_wait_list_number":0,"rsvp_regular_count":0,"rsvp_wait_count":0,"rsvp_external":false,"meeting_url":"","attendance_count":0,"current_attendance_count":0,"image":null,"stream_thumbnail":null,"level":"Intermediate","created_by_id":78190,"updated_by_id":27731,"show_sponsors":false,"duration":900,"creator_id":78190,"moderator_speaker_id":0,"selection_plan_id":23,"problem_addressed":null,"attendees_expected_learnt":"<p> The main goal of this presentation is to describe challenges and opportunities in the evolving ICT market, a novel thermal management technology and the importance of a consolidated supply chain.

The models leverage existing industry standards that are available; extensions and/or new standards will be defined as necessary. An initial release of CDXML Format captures data required for the design, integration and assembly of chiplet systems. CDXML sets a foundation for the standard machine-readable description of Chiplets, automates design and business processes across companies.

NVMe, using PCIe as the underlying transport, works very well for platform-bounded infrastructures. For external connectivity, the industry introduced NVMe-oF, which runs over multiple interfaces, but only a few are being used in the market. How does this impact traditional storage topologies such as server storage, storage arrays and SDS? What are the new components that make up the new topologies? Let’s fast forward to where NVMe and NVMe-oF are now the end-game for all storage connectivity; simply, NVMe for internal connectivity and NVMe-oF for external connectivity. In this presentation, we will review the makeover of the storage topologies with only NVMe and NVMe-oF, looking at the tradeoffs, impacts and what new topologies may arise.</p>","social_description":"","start_date":1666194300,"end_date":1666195200,"summit_id":40,"class_name":"Presentation","allow_feedback":false,"avg_feedback_rate":0,"is_published":true,"published_date":1665178579,"head_count":0,"rsvp_link":null,"rsvp_template_id":0,"rsvp_max_user_number":0,"rsvp_max_user_wait_list_number":0,"rsvp_regular_count":0,"rsvp_wait_count":0,"rsvp_external":false,"meeting_url":"","attendance_count":0,"current_attendance_count":0,"image":null,"stream_thumbnail":null,"level":"N/A","created_by_id":78212,"updated_by_id":27731,"show_sponsors":false,"duration":900,"creator_id":78212,"moderator_speaker_id":0,"selection_plan_id":23,"problem_addressed":null,"attendees_expected_learnt":"<p>TBD</p>","to_record":false,"attending_media":false,"status":"Accepted","progress":"COMPLETE","selection_status":"accepted","disclaimer_accepted_date":1655852439,"disclaimer_accepted":true,"custom_order":0,"attendee_votes_count":0,"rank":2,"sponsors":[],"tags":[],"feedback":[],"current_attendance":[],"type":{"id":496,"created":1648494509,"last_edited":1648494509,"name":"Presentation","class_name":"PresentationType","color":"#f0f0ee","black_out_times":false,"use_sponsors":true,"are_sponsors_mandatory":false,"allows_attachment":false,"allows_level":true,"allows_publishing_dates":true,"allows_location_timeframe_collision":true,"allows_location":true,"is_default":true,"summit_id":40,"max_speakers":3,"min_speakers":1,"max_moderators":0,"min_moderators":0,"use_speakers":true,"are_speakers_mandatory":true,"use_moderator":false,"is_moderator_mandatory":false,"moderator_label":"","should_be_available_on_cfp":false,"allow_custom_ordering":false,"allow_attendee_vote":false,"allows_speaker_event_collision":false,"summit_documents":[],"allowed_media_upload_types":[35,41]},"track":{"id":36067,"created":1650993696,"last_edited":1650993696,"name":"EW: Storage","description":"<p>Cloud storage device’s electro-mechanical, interface standards, API standards and storage appliance design contributions.</p>","code":"EW9","slug":"ew-storage","session_count":40,"alternate_count":5,"lightning_count":0,"lightning_alternate_count":0,"voting_visible":false,"chair_visible":true,"summit_id":40,"color":"#efc8fe","icon_url":"https://object-storage.public.mtl1.vexxhost.net/swift/v1/6e4619c416ff4bd19e1c087f27a43eea/assets-fn/summit-track-icon/OCP22G-FNSIGN-Icon-Storage.svg","order":9,"track_groups":[34],"allowed_tags":[],"extra_questions":[],"selection_lists":[587,628,736,741,766],"allowed_access_levels":[]},"location":{"id":330,"created":1651858107,"last_edited":1651858107,"name":"210BF","short_name":null,"description":"<p>210BF</p>","location_type":"Internal","order":8,"class_name":"SummitVenueRoom","capacity":300,"override_blackouts":false,"venue":{"id":323,"created":1651784235,"last_edited":1651784235,"name":"SJCC","short_name":"San Jose McEnery Convention Center","description":"<p>The San Jose McEnery Convention Center sits in the center of Downtown and boasts hundreds of varied events a year.

And, it has been demonstrated that three interleaved LLC converters can achieve further efficiency improvement at several kilowatts of power level. However, the magnetic components for multiphase LLC are complex, bulky, and difficult to manufacture in a cost-effective manner. In this paper, a high-frequency GaN-based three-phase LLC converter is utilized to attempt to address these challenges. With GaN operating at 500 kilohertz, all magnetic components, namely three inductors and six transformers, can be integrated into one common structure while all magnetic windings are contained in a compact 4-layer PCB with 3 oz. copper. The proposed structure can be easily and cost-effectively manufactured in high quantities. A 6kW 400V/48V 3-phase prototype is implemented, with a peak efficiency of 99.1% and a power density of 900W/in3 (56 kW/L)</p>","social_description":"","start_date":1666196100,"end_date":1666197000,"summit_id":40,"class_name":"Presentation","allow_feedback":false,"avg_feedback_rate":0,"is_published":true,"published_date":1660249737,"head_count":0,"rsvp_link":null,"rsvp_template_id":0,"rsvp_max_user_number":0,"rsvp_max_user_wait_list_number":0,"rsvp_regular_count":0,"rsvp_wait_count":0,"rsvp_external":false,"meeting_url":"","attendance_count":0,"current_attendance_count":0,"image":null,"stream_thumbnail":null,"level":"Advanced","created_by_id":31719,"updated_by_id":31719,"show_sponsors":false,"duration":900,"creator_id":31719,"moderator_speaker_id":0,"selection_plan_id":22,"problem_addressed":null,"attendees_expected_learnt":"<p>The utilization of PCB to build and integrate magnetic components (transformers and inductors) in high-density high-efficiency solution with high manufacturability.</p>","to_record":false,"attending_media":true,"status":"Accepted","progress":"COMPLETE","selection_status":"unaccepted","disclaimer_accepted_date":1650134827,"disclaimer_accepted":true,"custom_order":0,"attendee_votes_count":0,"rank":0,"sponsors":[],"tags":[],"feedback":[],"current_attendance":[],"type":{"id":502,"created":1648495439,"last_edited":1648495439,"name":"Symposium Poster & Presentation","class_name":"PresentationType","color":"#f0f0ee","black_out_times":false,"use_sponsors":false,"are_sponsors_mandatory":false,"allows_attachment":false,"allows_level":true,"allows_publishing_dates":true,"allows_location_timeframe_collision":false,"allows_location":true,"is_default":false,"summit_id":40,"max_speakers":5,"min_speakers":1,"max_moderators":0,"min_moderators":0,"use_speakers":true,"are_speakers_mandatory":true,"use_moderator":false,"is_moderator_mandatory":false,"moderator_label":"","should_be_available_on_cfp":false,"allow_custom_ordering":false,"allow_attendee_vote":false,"allows_speaker_event_collision":false,"summit_documents":[30],"allowed_media_upload_types":[34,36,37]},"track":{"id":36093,"created":1654907427,"last_edited":1654907427,"name":"Future Technologies Symposium","description":"<p>Future Technologies Symposium - all Categories</p>","code":"FTS","slug":"future-technologies-symposium","session_count":40,"alternate_count":10,"lightning_count":0,"lightning_alternate_count":0,"voting_visible":false,"chair_visible":true,"summit_id":40,"color":"#8cb3d0","icon_url":"https://object-storage.public.mtl1.vexxhost.net/swift/v1/6e4619c416ff4bd19e1c087f27a43eea/assets-fn/summit-track-icon/OCP22G-FNSIGN-Icon-FT-Symp.svg","order":27,"track_groups":[33],"allowed_tags":[],"extra_questions":[],"selection_lists":[774,775,776,778],"allowed_access_levels":[]},"location":{"id":334,"created":1651859800,"last_edited":1651859800,"name":"LL20BC","short_name":null,"description":"<p>LL20BC</p>","location_type":"Internal","order":12,"class_name":"SummitVenueRoom","capacity":200,"override_blackouts":false,"venue":{"id":323,"created":1651784235,"last_edited":1651784235,"name":"SJCC","short_name":"San Jose McEnery Convention Center","description":"<p>The San Jose McEnery Convention Center sits in the center of Downtown and boasts hundreds of varied events a year.
