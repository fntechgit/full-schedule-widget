without boundaries","description":"<p>Many communities around the world are underserved when it comes to infrastructure and connectivity. Individuals and organizations encounter barriers, often limited with a single non-local, cloud solution. In some cases, there is no option at all. Additionally, a lack of technology training programs can result in aspiring entrepreneurs and workers leaving the region for training, taking their skills and ideas with them. </p>\n<p>Many organizations and individuals are working separately to solve these problems. The OpenInfra community works best when we collaborate without boundaries by embracing the Four Opens. This session will establish an opportunity to level the playing field through open collaboration, creating a unified place to help these groups work together and share knowledge around solving these problems through open infrastructure, open connectivity, micro transactions, and technology training programs.</p>\n<p><a

Tortoise Beats the Hare: Upgrading the Operating System of the Cloud at Scale","description":"<p>At Bloomberg, the company’s private cloud, which is made of thousands of physical machines, has become the home of tens of thousands of VMs and the foundation for its core applications. When it came to upgrading the OS of the physical machines, we wanted to not only speed up the process, but also minimize the impact on our engineers and end-users. We had two options: either upgrade in place by using Ubuntu update-manager (the hare), or fully rebuild the entire fleet to a newer version of Ubuntu (the tortoise). Naturally, we wanted the faster approach of upgrading in-place.

At the same time, other well-established cloud solutions, such as OpenStack, have embraced K8s, providing infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) capabilities for traditional workloads, while running on the common substrate. But does packaging OpenStack services inside OCI images make it truly K8s-native? Of course not. Being K8s-native means much more than just containers. It means common interfaces and common operations patterns.</p>\n<p>During this session, we will first walk you through a few OpenStack and Kubernetes integration options. Once we have a general understanding of how the two software projects complement one another, we will discuss a particular use case with OpenStack deployed on top of K8s using the Kubernetes operator pattern. Finally, we will wrap up with a brief introduction to a new open-source project - K8s-native OpenStack - and hopefully, show it live!</p>","social_description":"While Kubernetes has become a standard for delivering applications and infrastructure, packaging OpenStack inside OCI images doesn’t make it K8s-native yet.

processing, memory, etc. is crucial. OpenStack acts like an umbrella encompassing major drivers & its effective communication that enables a cloud eco-system. It is quite robust, and we in our team have been stretching its boundaries, successfully being able to deploy and manage an OpenStack-operated private cloud of 4M cores at the production-level for 6 years now. Using this as our IaaS platform, we provide our users with services like managed Kubernetes, MySql, DNS, Load Balancers & more.  </p>\n<p>The goal of this talk is to give insights into our journey over the last 1 year, from getting introduced to OpenStack to learning to manage and operate a production-level private cloud using OpenStack, including the various challenges we faced during this time.

They desire a shared-nothing approach if economics could afford it. This stems from the fact that unauthorized access to data or critical infrastructure, whether it is malicious must be avoided at all costs. So it is upon OpenStack administrators to design the cloud in which a large number of untrusted tenants can co-exist and share expensive infrastructure in a secure manner. The Shared File Systems service (Manila) makes this easy with the use of on-demand, dedicated, tenant-controlled share servers. Through this presentation, we will showcase configuration best practices and pitfalls of real world cases with hard multi-tenancy setups for network attached storage. We will also demonstrate day-2 operations associated with share servers. We'll discuss how some of the same approaches can be followed in deployments without dedicated share servers, such as with consumers of CephFS.</p>","social_description":"Things to know before offering shared file systems in your multi-tenant cloud","start_date":1686680100,"end_date":1686681000,"summit_id":33,"class_name":"Presentation","allow_feedback":false,"avg_feedback_rate":0,"is_published":true,"published_date":1678375972,"head_count":0,"rsvp_link":null,"rsvp_template_id":0,"rsvp_max_user_number":0,"rsvp_max_user_wait_list_number":0,"rsvp_regular_count":0,"rsvp_wait_count":0,"rsvp_external":false,"meeting_url":"","attendance_count":0,"current_attendance_count":0,"image":null,"stream_thumbnail":null,"level":"Intermediate","created_by_id":35705,"updated_by_id":141463,"show_sponsors":false,"duration":900,"creator_id":35705,"moderator_speaker_id":0,"selection_plan_id":19,"problem_addressed":null,"attendees_expected_learnt":"<ul>\n  <li>The choice between the hard multitenancy and the non-hard multitenancy mode in Manila</li>\n  <li>Deep dive into the share server design that provides data path and network isolation guarantees between tenants, even while sharing the same back end storage</li>\n  <li>Day two operations that concern share servers:\n    <ul>\n      <li>Configuring share servers and manipulating limits</li>\n      <li>Bringing external share servers into Manila</li>\n      <li>Scaling and rebalancing exports</li>\n      <li>Bringing your own authentication (AD, LDAP, Kerberos)</li>\n      <li>Migrating share servers</li>\n      <li>Replicating shares across availability zones</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>","to_record":false,"attending_media":false,"status":"Accepted","progress":"COMPLETE","selection_status":"alternate","disclaimer_accepted_date":null,"disclaimer_accepted":false,"custom_order":0,"attendee_votes_count":0,"rank":17,"views_count":3,"comments_count":1,"popularity_score":4,"votes_count":0,"votes_average":0,"votes_total_points":0,"track_chair_avg_score":0,"passers_count":0,"likers_count":2,"selectors_count":1,"sponsors":[],"tags":[{"id":4844,"created":1667666431,"last_edited":1667666431,"tag":"Demo‎"},{"id":4591,"created":1515100722,"last_edited":1515694422,"tag":"Technical"},{"id":4649,"created":1515695809,"last_edited":1515695809,"tag":"OpenStack"},{"id":1249,"created":1436410589,"last_edited":1436410589,"tag":"Manila"},{"id":884,"created":1434842030,"last_edited":1499285107,"tag":"Security"},{"id":4832,"created":1667666205,"last_edited":1667666205,"tag":"Compliance‎"},{"id":14,"created":1419274668,"last_edited":1419274668,"tag":"Case Study"},{"id":964,"created":1435267419,"last_edited":1499285065,"tag":"101"}],"feedback":[],"current_attendance":[],"type":{"id":281,"created":1661793676,"last_edited":1661793676,"name":"Lightning Talks","class_name":"PresentationType","color":"#f0f0ee","black_out_times":false,"use_sponsors":false,"are_sponsors_mandatory":false,"allows_attachment":false,"allows_level":true,"allows_publishing_dates":true,"allows_location_timeframe_collision":false,"allows_location":true,"is_default":true,"summit_id":33,"max_speakers":3,"min_speakers":1,"max_moderators":0,"min_moderators":0,"use_speakers":true,"are_speakers_mandatory":true,"use_moderator":false,"is_moderator_mandatory":false,"moderator_label":null,"should_be_available_on_cfp":true,"allow_custom_ordering":false,"allow_attendee_vote":false,"allows_speaker_event_collision":false,"summit_documents":[],"allowed_media_upload_types":[]},"track":{"id":421,"created":1662412913,"last_edited":1662412913,"name":"Private & Hybrid Cloud","description":"<p>Topics include: architecture, bare metal, economics, hardware, operations, orchestration &amp;

At STACKIT we started with OpenStack Queens some years ago and we now made a bet that upgrading over all versions to Yoga is more bumpy than a \"direct\" upgrade. So therefore, we decided that we build a second OpenStack environment and migrate all the workload. In this talk we would like to show you all the elements we created, to migrate the customer workload on a per project basis. To ensure that our customers to not need to care about changing API endpoints we built a so-called Project-Routing-Reverse-Proxy to send requests to their environments in the correct OpenStack cluster. Also, we want to talk about the actual migration and the hacks we did to accomplish a minimum of downtime. Of course, we want to answer the question, if we would do it again.</p>","social_description":"Migrating OpenStack from Queens to Yoga, the challenges and elements we build to accomplish a migration.

private 5G campus network enabled and powered by OpenStack and StarlingX","description":"<p>In Germany, companies and universities have been able to operate their own private mobile networks since the release of 5G frequencies. At Osnabrück University of Applied Sciences, a five-year research project has been implemented since mid-2022 as part of a private 5G campus network. The self-managed 5G stand alone network in the 3.7-3.8GHz range without public slices is used to research 5G use cases. The central component of the IT infrastructure is the open source software OpenStack, which has been in use since 2016, and StarlingX from 2023 to implement a mobile edge cloud in a mobile data center. The planned, e.g. latency-critical use cases are located in the AR/XR and logistics, sensor technology and smart factory as well as autonomous robotics/drones areas. In a sub-project, a separate application using Magma and OpenRAN is to be implemented from the end of 2023. The entire project ends in mid-2027.</p>","social_description":"The implementation of a private and self-managed 5G campus network at Osnabrück University of Applie","start_date":1686689100,"end_date":1686690900,"summit_id":33,"class_name":"Presentation","allow_feedback":false,"avg_feedback_rate":0,"is_published":true,"published_date":1675093758,"head_count":0,"rsvp_link":null,"rsvp_template_id":0,"rsvp_max_user_number":0,"rsvp_max_user_wait_list_number":0,"rsvp_regular_count":0,"rsvp_wait_count":0,"rsvp_external":false,"meeting_url":null,"attendance_count":0,"current_attendance_count":0,"image":null,"stream_thumbnail":null,"level":"Beginner","created_by_id":79529,"updated_by_id":141463,"show_sponsors":false,"duration":1800,"creator_id":79529,"moderator_speaker_id":0,"selection_plan_id":19,"problem_addressed":null,"attendees_expected_learnt":"<p>Essentially, it is about the fact that the project would not have been feasible without open source software, in particular through OpenStack and StarlingX, from the university's point of view.

This led to the launch of OpenStack in July 2010.   </p>\n<p class=\"p1\">After launching OpenStack, my focus shifted full time to community building activitites to grow OpenStack, as Vice President of Business Development and Marketing for OpenStack.  </p>\n<p class=\"p4\">The ecosystem and the brand have grown in concert, as new organizations that we've attracted have helped spread the word and improve the OpenStack software by hiring dozens of OpenStack developers, delivering solutions that meet the needs of users such as Cisco Webex, eBay, Mercado Libre, and Paypal.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">In 2011, I began the work of establishing the independent OpenStack Foundation, along with Jonathan Bryce (now Executive Director) and many others throughout the community.  This open process included writing and revising the basic structure, principles, and ultimately the bylaws in an open manner, until we launched the new independent foundation in the Fall of 2012.  The establishment of a User Committee is one of the most vital components of the new structure, IMHO, as in the end the software is for the users, and that is who we must fight for.</p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">I'm now the Chief Operating Officer of the OpenStack Foundation, and work full time to achieve the OpenStack Foundation Mission focused on \"</span><span class=\"s2\"><strong><em>Protecting</em></strong><em>,</em><strong><em> Empowering</em></strong><em>, and </em><strong><em>Promoting </em></strong><em>OpenStack software and the community around it, including users, developers and the entire ecosystem.\"</em></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Outside of OpenStack, I love music, Austin, BBQ, wakeboarding on Lake Austin, and basketball (Rockets &amp; Longhorns fan).

These require the most innovative and optimised infrastructure around them to allow for efficient utilisation. Maximising data ingress and processing bandwidth at every point is essential to meet the data demands of AI. The flexible network architecture of the IPU-POD products also means that the scale of the processing can be adjusted according to need, splitting or joining resources to support different sizes of workload.</p>\n<p> Traditional deployment methods allow such infrastructure to be built but it’s very time-consuming and does not allow for rapid changes of tenant or use-model, which is why Graphcore have adopted OpenStack as the reference platform for building platforms, services and entire clouds. Using infrastructure as code (Terraform, Ansible and Packer) allows for rapid reconfiguration at every level;  including RDMA via SRIOV which is critical to the function of the IPU product. Graphcore and StackHPC present a demonstration and walkthrough of the Terraform configuration.</p>","social_description":"","start_date":1686698520,"end_date":1686699000,"summit_id":33,"class_name":"Presentation","allow_feedback":false,"avg_feedback_rate":0,"is_published":true,"published_date":1683665894,"head_count":0,"rsvp_link":null,"rsvp_template_id":0,"rsvp_max_user_number":0,"rsvp_max_user_wait_list_number":0,"rsvp_regular_count":0,"rsvp_wait_count":0,"rsvp_external":false,"meeting_url":"","attendance_count":0,"current_attendance_count":0,"image":null,"stream_thumbnail":null,"level":"N/A","created_by_id":141463,"updated_by_id":141463,"show_sponsors":false,"duration":480,"creator_id":141463,"moderator_speaker_id":0,"selection_plan_id":0,"problem_addressed":null,"attendees_expected_learnt":"","to_record":false,"attending_media":false,"status":"Accepted","progress":"COMPLETE","selection_status":"unaccepted","disclaimer_accepted_date":null,"disclaimer_accepted":false,"custom_order":0,"attendee_votes_count":0,"rank":null,"views_count":0,"comments_count":0,"popularity_score":0,"votes_count":0,"votes_average":0,"votes_total_points":0,"track_chair_avg_score":0,"passers_count":0,"likers_count":0,"selectors_count":0,"sponsors":[],"tags":[],"feedback":[],"current_attendance":[],"type":{"id":279,"created":1661793676,"last_edited":1661793676,"name":"Keynotes","class_name":"PresentationType","color":"#f0f0ee","black_out_times":false,"use_sponsors":false,"are_sponsors_mandatory":false,"allows_attachment":false,"allows_level":true,"allows_publishing_dates":true,"allows_location_timeframe_collision":false,"allows_location":true,"is_default":true,"summit_id":33,"max_speakers":3,"min_speakers":1,"max_moderators":1,"min_moderators":0,"use_speakers":true,"are_speakers_mandatory":true,"use_moderator":true,"is_moderator_mandatory":false,"moderator_label":null,"should_be_available_on_cfp":false,"allow_custom_ordering":false,"allow_attendee_vote":false,"allows_speaker_event_collision":false,"summit_documents":[],"allowed_media_upload_types":[]},"track":{"id":427,"created":1662412913,"last_edited":1662412913,"name":"Keynotes","description":"<p>Keynotes</p>","code":"K$","slug":"keynotes","session_count":0,"alternate_count":0,"lightning_count":0,"lightning_alternate_count":0,"voting_visible":false,"chair_visible":false,"summit_id":33,"color":"#bdccf5","icon_url":null,"order":17,"track_groups":[],"allowed_tags":[4707,4626,4627,4628,822,1270,500,4632,22,4634,4709,4635,31,4636,1300,4638,355,2080,1114,4642,2582,4644,4645,4646,4648,4649,4650,4817,4654,1273,4694,1653,32,4659,4660,1649,4662,4647,461,4664,1970,4624],"extra_questions":[],"selection_lists":[],"proposed_schedule_allowed_locations":[],"allowed_access_levels":[]},"location":{"id":554,"created":1675092402,"last_edited":1675092402,"name":"Ballroom

We’ve taken infrastructure from core to edge to far edge, connected and integrated. The next logical step is the “last mile”, connecting intelligent edge systems and devices to this infrastructure across verticals – automotive, A&D, medical, industrial, telco, etc.We expect the new intelligent edge will take the form of distributed edge clouds which integrate VMs and containers with heterogeneous devices and sensors/actuators. StarlingX and the OIF LOKI stack acknowledge this VM and K8s coexistence as a requirement.New killer apps and use cases will drive requirements for new functionality. Our talk outlines a few examples where StarlingX provides the underlying infrastructure for the intelligent edge.

Next Generation Security with Zero Trust Architecture","description":"<p><em>StarlingX software stack owing to its reliability, scalability, small footprint, ultra-low latency and security has promoted it for being base operating system for 5G distributed telecom RAN (Radio Access Network). The foundation of a robust security architecture rests on three pillars: people, processes and technology. The 5G specifications are now aligned with the zero trust tenets. This means that the telecommunications industry is in a strong position to create a 5G zero trust architecture. This paper describes the requirements, challenges and proposals around building a next generation security model based on zero trust for the StarlingX Distributed Multi-Cloud Environments.  Paper discusses creation of a security policy engine, one whose policies will take input from various related hardware/software components and output a security policy applicable per workflow.</em> </p>","social_description":"","start_date":1686760800,"end_date":1686762600,"summit_id":33,"class_name":"Presentation","allow_feedback":false,"avg_feedback_rate":0,"is_published":true,"published_date":1682454108,"head_count":0,"rsvp_link":null,"rsvp_template_id":0,"rsvp_max_user_number":0,"rsvp_max_user_wait_list_number":0,"rsvp_regular_count":0,"rsvp_wait_count":0,"rsvp_external":false,"meeting_url":"","attendance_count":0,"current_attendance_count":0,"image":null,"stream_thumbnail":null,"level":"Intermediate","created_by_id":145404,"updated_by_id":141463,"show_sponsors":false,"duration":1800,"creator_id":145404,"moderator_speaker_id":0,"selection_plan_id":19,"problem_addressed":null,"attendees_expected_learnt":"<p><br

In this context, OpenStack has emerged as a popular choice for managing private cloud environments. One key strategy for ensuring high availability of virtual machines in OpenStack is server group customizing, which involves grouping VMs together and using load balancing and auto scaling. Auto scaling in/out integrated with monitoring is another key strategy. By automatically scaling resources up or down in response to changes in demand, organizations can ensure that their services remain available. Finally, live migration is another technique. By enabling VMs to be moved between physical hosts with no downtime, live migration helps to ensure that services remain available even during hardware maintenance or upgrades.</p>","social_description":"As the scale of private cloud data centers continues to grow, optimizing service continuity has become a critical challenge.

templated abstraction model.  These give OpenStack users a simple method to create and manage deployments using various container orchestration platforms.  However, over time it has solely focused and specialized on Kubernetes.</p>\n<p>Kubernetes is rapidly evolving; lately Magnum driver development and maintenance has struggled to keep pace.  This has resulted in limitations that can be frustrating for users of the important service that Magnum provides.</p>\n<p>We present a new Magnum Kubernetes driver, based on the ClusterAPI provisioning engine.  The driver harnesses upstream functionality to dramatically simplify the code base and maintenance for Magnum.  It also provides a fast path to new capabilities, and leverages code widely tested across many infrastructures.  At

Reliability and survivability are paramount for the most demanding industries like Telecom and A&D.  Therefore, StarlingX is adding support for a geographically redundant DC control plane to complement the already geographically distributed edge-clouds.  Geographic redundancy adds an additional layer of protection to StarlingX, enabling full network control and availability. StarlingX is deployed at massive scales, reaching 100K+ geographically distributed systems.  Network operators want reduced network address requirements and a flexible network design to deal with the network scale.

your budget with cloud optimisation techniques","description":"<p>Budgeting is a non-trivial task, especially in constantly changing market conditions as we’ve all seen in 2022. When most of costs are rising, knowing how to reduce at least some of your expenses to meet your budget is a key skill. Since cloud infrastructure usually accounts for a significant portion of organisations’ budget, applying cloud cost optimisation techniques is essential to achieving total cost of ownership (TCO) reduction.</p>\n<p>During this session, we will present Canonical’s cloud cost optimisation techniques. Starting from public clouds, we will demonstrate how to lower the cost of running workloads in the leading hyperscaler clouds. Later, we will showcase cost analyses from sample cost scenarios and demonstrate why adopting hybrid multi-cloud architecture leads to TCO reduction when running workloads in the long term and at a large scale.

parties\" to collaborate on bugfixes and security issues that crop up late in the life-cycle of an openstack release. Since then the uptake has been.... wanting. OpenStack is in a different place, the developer community has shrunk.  So now we need to decide what's next.</p>\n<p>The purpose of this session is to float ideas around what we want from stable

It used to work properly with Moby, at the cost of complex architecture and extra management burdens. As the project developed, such complexity and burden became a blocker to its wider production adoption. As a result, when Kata Containers 2.0 was designed and developed, it was decided that it had to break with Moby in favor of a simpler and cleaner architecture.</p>\n<p>Ever since then, the request of running Kata Containers with Moby has never vanished. Various attempts were tried by different developers. Finally, with the latest Moby and Kata Containers, we are pleased to announce that the two projects can once again work together.</p>\n<p>The presentation will look back on the history, show what happened in this area, why things went south in the middle, and how we fixed it in the end.

new in Nova power management and sustainability","description":"<p>At the Berlin OpenInfra Summit, there was a keynote explaining how to get power metrics from compute hosts and instances using the Scaphandre project.</p>\n<p>This was the inception of the sustainability initiative in Nova. After this keynote, power management in Nova became an important topic of discussion in the Nova community, and led to the implementation of features that allow operators to tweak the performance and power usage of their clouds. Nova now comes with power management support!</p>\n<p>In this talk, we present what we've worked on for the last few cycles, dig into the implementation a little bit, and explain how the feature works and how to use it. We'll then explore how operators can leverage this work to improve their cloud's sustainability.</p>","social_description":"","start_date":1686780600,"end_date":1686782400,"summit_id":33,"class_name":"Presentation","allow_feedback":false,"avg_feedback_rate":0,"is_published":true,"published_date":1675876785,"head_count":0,"rsvp_link":null,"rsvp_template_id":0,"rsvp_max_user_number":0,"rsvp_max_user_wait_list_number":0,"rsvp_regular_count":0,"rsvp_wait_count":0,"rsvp_external":false,"meeting_url":"","attendance_count":0,"current_attendance_count":0,"image":null,"stream_thumbnail":null,"level":"Intermediate","created_by_id":8407,"updated_by_id":141463,"show_sponsors":false,"duration":1800,"creator_id":8407,"moderator_speaker_id":0,"selection_plan_id":19,"problem_addressed":null,"attendees_expected_learnt":"<p>They'll

An important example is <code>type=LoadBalancer</code> Services integration that allows you to expose apps outside of the cluster. In OpenStack that's implemented by cloud-provider-openstack and Octavia.</p>\n<p>While enabling that integration in OpenShift, we've learned it is only simple in theory. To successfully fulfill all your workload's expectations you need to make choices regarding the OpenStack version you run, the Octavia provider you use and the cloud-provider configuration you set.</p>\n<p>In this talk we will explore details of how K8s-Octavia integration works and the Octavia quirks that affect it. We'll cover pros and cons of various cloud-provider configuration choices, based on features you expect to work correctly. You can expect to learn how to troubleshoot common Octavia integration problems as well. We'll also look at alternative solutions to expose K8s Services when Octavia won't cover all your bases.</p>","social_description":"Are you wondering how K8s' cloud-provider-openstack integrates with Octavia?

This can be accomplished by deploying Openstack at the edge, in locations such as cell towers, retail stores, and factories however managing edge workloads poses significant challenges due to the diverse and often resource-constrained nature of edge devices, as well as the complexity of the edge ecosystem. In this presentation, we present a technical overview of deploying edge workloads using OpenStack. </p>\n<p>We will discuss the benefits of pushing OpenStack workloads to the edge and explore the challenges and considerations involved in doing so.  We will also describe how to deploy and configure OpenStack at the edge, including some examples of deployment topologies and the results they have achieved. Finally, we will provide some best practices for deploying and managing OpenStack at the edge.</p>","social_description":"Come learn about using OpenStack to deploy and manage edge workloads in our

managed by the foundation. This is both error prone and ideally is opening too many possibilities for faking data.<br />\n</p>\n<p>An alternative approach which would both save public clouds from the burden of running tests and guaranteeing results validity is to reverse the process. Tests should be performed from the foundation side and clouds are providing testing credentials to the foundation.<br />\n</p>\n<p>Another aspect of the modified testing is an idea to reuse existing functional tests of OpenStackSDK/CLI and ansible as real tools used by customers. This way not only the cloud can be certified for OpenStack compliancy, but also a guarantee can be given that OpenStack client facing tools are working with this

I’ve grown other projects along the way, helped build tooling and communities, some successful and still running today, others were just flashes in the pan.

AI's demanding data needs at Graphcore using Infrastructure as Code","description":"<p> Graphcore provide AI solutions using their own IPU (Intelligence Processing Unit) chips, and the fastest networking interfaces and devices available. These require the most innovative and optimised infrastructure around them to allow for efficient utilisation. Maximising data ingress and processing bandwidth at every point is essential to meet the data demands of AI. The flexible network architecture of the IPU-POD products also means that the scale of the processing can be adjusted according to need, splitting or joining resources to support different sizes of workload.</p>\n<p> Traditional deployment methods allow such infrastructure to be built but it’s very time-consuming and does not allow for rapid changes of tenant or use-model, which is why Graphcore have adopted OpenStack as the reference platform for building platforms, services and entire clouds. Using infrastructure as code (Terraform, Ansible and Packer) allows for rapid reconfiguration at every level;  including RDMA via SRIOV which is critical to the function of the IPU product. Graphcore and StackHPC present a demonstration and walkthrough of the Terraform configuration.</p>","social_description":"","start_date":1686847200,"end_date":1686849000,"summit_id":33,"class_name":"Presentation","allow_feedback":false,"avg_feedback_rate":0,"is_published":true,"published_date":1684855364,"head_count":0,"rsvp_link":null,"rsvp_template_id":0,"rsvp_max_user_number":0,"rsvp_max_user_wait_list_number":0,"rsvp_regular_count":0,"rsvp_wait_count":0,"rsvp_external":false,"meeting_url":"","attendance_count":0,"current_attendance_count":0,"image":null,"stream_thumbnail":null,"level":"N/A","created_by_id":141463,"updated_by_id":141463,"show_sponsors":false,"duration":1800,"creator_id":141463,"moderator_speaker_id":0,"selection_plan_id":0,"problem_addressed":null,"attendees_expected_learnt":"","to_record":false,"attending_media":false,"status":"Accepted","progress":"COMPLETE","selection_status":"unaccepted","disclaimer_accepted_date":null,"disclaimer_accepted":false,"custom_order":0,"attendee_votes_count":0,"rank":null,"views_count":0,"comments_count":0,"popularity_score":0,"votes_count":0,"votes_average":0,"votes_total_points":0,"track_chair_avg_score":0,"passers_count":0,"likers_count":0,"selectors_count":0,"sponsors":[],"tags":[],"feedback":[],"current_attendance":[],"type":{"id":278,"created":1661793676,"last_edited":1661793676,"name":"Presentation","class_name":"PresentationType","color":"#f0f0ee","black_out_times":false,"use_sponsors":false,"are_sponsors_mandatory":false,"allows_attachment":false,"allows_level":true,"allows_publishing_dates":true,"allows_location_timeframe_collision":false,"allows_location":true,"is_default":true,"summit_id":33,"max_speakers":3,"min_speakers":1,"max_moderators":0,"min_moderators":0,"use_speakers":true,"are_speakers_mandatory":true,"use_moderator":false,"is_moderator_mandatory":false,"moderator_label":null,"should_be_available_on_cfp":true,"allow_custom_ordering":false,"allow_attendee_vote":false,"allows_speaker_event_collision":false,"summit_documents":[],"allowed_media_upload_types":[]},"track":{"id":421,"created":1662412913,"last_edited":1662412913,"name":"Private & Hybrid Cloud","description":"<p>Topics include: architecture, bare metal, economics, hardware, operations, orchestration &amp;

While starting development in the public cloud is oftentimes logical, the escalating expenses and lack of flexibility become apparent as companies expand. The cost of idle resources and the impact on pricing goods or services creates a pressing need for alternative solutions, whether it’s for development, staging or production.</p>\n<p>We present OpenStack and Ceph as powerful tools for creating personalized cloud environments. By embracing these open-source technologies, businesses can leverage the same capabilities offered by public clouds, including VMs, Object Storage, Kubernetes, Load Balancers, shared file systems, and key/value stores and more. With OpenStack and Ceph, organizations can regain control over their infrastructure, extracting more value than they could otherwise at no cost.</p>\n<p>By understanding the underlying technology and owning the resources of the entire cloud footprint, businesses can leverage excess capacity at no additional cost. We emphasize that access to expertise and assistance shouldn't be limited to industry giants but should be available to all, leveling the playing field.</p>\n<p>Join us as we explore how OpenStack and Ceph clouds are effective solutions that empower businesses to escape vendor lock-in, reduce costs, and unlock the hidden potential of their own cloud environments. We discuss a safe landing footprint and a strategy for growth and scalability. Discover the freedom to innovate and the ability to tailor infrastructure to your specific needs, all while ensuring simplicity and scalability.</p>","social_description":"","start_date":1686849300,"end_date":1686850200,"summit_id":33,"class_name":"Presentation","allow_feedback":false,"avg_feedback_rate":0,"is_published":true,"published_date":1684256658,"head_count":0,"rsvp_link":null,"rsvp_template_id":0,"rsvp_max_user_number":0,"rsvp_max_user_wait_list_number":0,"rsvp_regular_count":0,"rsvp_wait_count":0,"rsvp_external":false,"meeting_url":"","attendance_count":0,"current_attendance_count":0,"image":null,"stream_thumbnail":null,"level":"N/A","created_by_id":141463,"updated_by_id":141463,"show_sponsors":false,"duration":900,"creator_id":141463,"moderator_speaker_id":0,"selection_plan_id":19,"problem_addressed":null,"attendees_expected_learnt":"","to_record":false,"attending_media":false,"status":"Accepted","progress":"COMPLETE","selection_status":"unaccepted","disclaimer_accepted_date":null,"disclaimer_accepted":false,"custom_order":0,"attendee_votes_count":0,"rank":null,"views_count":0,"comments_count":0,"popularity_score":0,"votes_count":0,"votes_average":0,"votes_total_points":0,"track_chair_avg_score":0,"passers_count":0,"likers_count":0,"selectors_count":0,"sponsors":[],"tags":[],"feedback":[],"current_attendance":[],"type":{"id":278,"created":1661793676,"last_edited":1661793676,"name":"Presentation","class_name":"PresentationType","color":"#f0f0ee","black_out_times":false,"use_sponsors":false,"are_sponsors_mandatory":false,"allows_attachment":false,"allows_level":true,"allows_publishing_dates":true,"allows_location_timeframe_collision":false,"allows_location":true,"is_default":true,"summit_id":33,"max_speakers":3,"min_speakers":1,"max_moderators":0,"min_moderators":0,"use_speakers":true,"are_speakers_mandatory":true,"use_moderator":false,"is_moderator_mandatory":false,"moderator_label":null,"should_be_available_on_cfp":true,"allow_custom_ordering":false,"allow_attendee_vote":false,"allows_speaker_event_collision":false,"summit_documents":[],"allowed_media_upload_types":[]},"track":{"id":421,"created":1662412913,"last_edited":1662412913,"name":"Private & Hybrid Cloud","description":"<p>Topics include: architecture, bare metal, economics, hardware, operations, orchestration &amp; hybrid cloud tools, networking, organizational culture &amp; processes, security &amp; compliance, SLAs, storage, upgrades, user experience, vendor selection&nbsp;</p>","code":"PHC","slug":"private-hybrid-cloud","session_count":15,"alternate_count":2,"lightning_count":0,"lightning_alternate_count":0,"voting_visible":true,"chair_visible":true,"summit_id":33,"color":"#ade5b2","icon_url":null,"order":11,"track_groups":[95],"allowed_tags":[964,4590,14,4844,4594,4591,4592,4707,4626,4846,4627,4628,822,1270,500,4632,22,4634,4709,4635,31,4636,4825,1300,4638,355,2080,4838,4827,1114,4642,2582,4644,4645,4646,4648,4839,4649,4650,4826,4817,4654,1273,4694,4840,1653,32,4659,4841,4842,4660,1649,4662,4647,461,4664,1970,4624,4831,4822,837,4832,370,4820,4819,4845,4816,4815,4830,4833,4834,4693,1363,4836,4837,884,4818,4843,4597,4849,4552,3537,493,4599,4848,1765,1142,1435,37,38,1116,36,4603,3540,4668,4829,4554,1249,4847,1913,797,357,35,34,4606,4812,4096,4608,4823,4609,4667,3543,1008,1383,1525,4814,4615,4085,1064,3539,4619,39,4828,3939,4110,3547,4622,4284],"extra_questions":[],"selection_lists":[1556,1557,1572,1591,1594,1596,1602,1606,1613],"proposed_schedule_allowed_locations":[],"allowed_access_levels":[]},"location":{"id":550,"created":1675091981,"last_edited":1675091981,"name":"OpenInfra Stage","short_name":null,"description":"","location_type":"Internal","order":6,"opening_hour":null,"closing_hour":null,"class_name":"SummitVenueRoom","floor_id":0,"capacity":0,"override_blackouts":false,"venue":{"id":545,"created":1675091670,"last_edited":1675091670,"name":"Vancouver Convention Centre","short_name":"","description":"","location_type":"Internal","order":1,"opening_hour":null,"closing_hour":null,"class_name":"SummitVenue","address_1":"1055 Canada Pl","address_2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Vancouver","state":"BC","country":"CA","lng":"-123.1207375","lat":"49.2827291","website_url":"","display_on_site":false,"details_page":false,"location_message":"","is_main":true,"published_events":[25882,25883,25884],"rooms":[546,547,548,549,550,551,552,553,554,555,557,559,560,562,563,564,565,566,567,568,569,570,571,572,573,574,575,576,577,578,579]},"published_events":[25437,25520,25559,25586,25591,25648,25692,25702,25703,25715,25724,25767,25781,25796,25816,25837,25870,25876,25893,25902,25904,25919,25929,25932,25934,25939,25976]},"speakers":[{"id":17170,"created":1684253862,"last_edited":1684254166,"first_name":"Yuriy","last_name":"Shyyan","title":"Technical Product Owner","bio":"<p>Yuriy is a highly determined and experienced professional with over a decade of expertise in the IT space.

Since 2021 it is available as opensource. The Yaook project aims to be the next step in automating deployment and operation of OpenStack clouds. In its core, it relies on Kubernetes operators, small pieces of code which compare observed and intended state in order to determine actions to converge the system. This idea can, however, be taken to a next level: What if there was a control loop which managed an entire OpenStack deployment? Yaook provides just that. Beyond the initial installation, it supports \"Day 2 operation\" tasks, such as upgrades and node maintenance / reinstallation. At the same time, Yaook knows its limits and will wait for human operator input in cases of potential loss of data or availability. That way, Yaook makes for a resilient and reliable life-cycle management of OpenStack clouds. </p>","social_description":"Managing an OpenStack environment is not easy.

This is especially true with the growing number of edge deployments requiring IPv4 endpoints.</p>\n<p>OpenStack Designate is adding a new feature called “Shared Zones” that allows sharing a single DNS zone with multiple OpenStack projects. This not only allows two or more projects to manage recordsets in the zone, but enables “Classless IN-ADDR.ARPA delegation” (RFC 2317) in Designate. Classless IN-ADDR.ARPA delegation allows IP address DNS PTR record assignment in smaller blocks without creating a DNS zone per address.</p>\n<p>This talk will introduce the new “Shared Zones” feature with use case examples.

inclusive, level playing ground where all the voices are heard and anyone can rise to leadership positions. Sustainable open source projects embrace this mentality, removing barriers for individuals and organizations of all sizes from around the world to collaborate. However, participating in an upstream community can often be challenging. As organizations enter the open source ecosystem, they often need to go through a cutural and mindset change to integrate open collaboration into their business and processes and help their employees balance their community work with day-to-day activities and become upstream contributors. This panel is comprised of active contributors in the OpenStack community to share their open source experience in how they joined the project, what challenges they've overcome and how they've been balancing business and open collaboration.</p>","social_description":"","start_date":1686854400,"end_date":1686856200,"summit_id":33,"class_name":"Presentation","allow_feedback":false,"avg_feedback_rate":0,"is_published":true,"published_date":1685125405,"head_count":0,"rsvp_link":null,"rsvp_template_id":0,"rsvp_max_user_number":0,"rsvp_max_user_wait_list_number":0,"rsvp_regular_count":0,"rsvp_wait_count":0,"rsvp_external":false,"meeting_url":"","attendance_count":0,"current_attendance_count":0,"image":null,"stream_thumbnail":null,"level":"N/A","created_by_id":141463,"updated_by_id":141463,"show_sponsors":false,"duration":1800,"creator_id":141463,"moderator_speaker_id":5699,"selection_plan_id":0,"problem_addressed":null,"attendees_expected_learnt":"","to_record":false,"attending_media":false,"status":"Accepted","progress":"COMPLETE","selection_status":"unaccepted","disclaimer_accepted_date":null,"disclaimer_accepted":false,"custom_order":0,"attendee_votes_count":0,"rank":null,"views_count":0,"comments_count":0,"popularity_score":0,"votes_count":0,"votes_average":0,"votes_total_points":0,"track_chair_avg_score":0,"passers_count":0,"likers_count":0,"selectors_count":0,"sponsors":[],"tags":[],"feedback":[],"current_attendance":[],"type":{"id":280,"created":1661793676,"last_edited":1661793676,"name":"Panel","class_name":"PresentationType","color":"#f0f0ee","black_out_times":false,"use_sponsors":false,"are_sponsors_mandatory":false,"allows_attachment":false,"allows_level":true,"allows_publishing_dates":true,"allows_location_timeframe_collision":false,"allows_location":true,"is_default":true,"summit_id":33,"max_speakers":3,"min_speakers":1,"max_moderators":1,"min_moderators":0,"use_speakers":true,"are_speakers_mandatory":true,"use_moderator":true,"is_moderator_mandatory":false,"moderator_label":null,"should_be_available_on_cfp":true,"allow_custom_ordering":false,"allow_attendee_vote":false,"allows_speaker_event_collision":false,"summit_documents":[],"allowed_media_upload_types":[]},"track":{"id":420,"created":1662412913,"last_edited":1662412913,"name":"Open Development","description":"<p>Topics include: the 4 opens, the future of free and open source software, challenges of open collaboration, open development best practices and tools, open source governance models, diversity and inclusion, mentoring and outreach, community management.</p>","code":"OD","slug":"open-development","session_count":5,"alternate_count":2,"lightning_count":0,"lightning_alternate_count":0,"voting_visible":true,"chair_visible":true,"summit_id":33,"color":"#f78749","icon_url":null,"order":10,"track_groups":[95],"allowed_tags":[964,4707,4626,4846,4843,4590,4597,4822,4627,14,4552,4628,822,1270,3537,493,500,4599,837,370,4820,4819,4632,1765,22,4816,4634,4709,4635,1142,1435,4815,31,4594,37,38,1116,4636,4825,4638,36,4603,355,3540,2080,4668,4829,4838,4554,1249,4827,1114,1913,797,4642,357,2582,35,34,4693,1363,4606,4644,4645,4646,4648,4812,4839,4649,4096,4608,4823,4609,4667,4650,4826,4817,4654,1273,3543,1008,4694,4840,1383,1653,884,1525,4814,4615,32,4659,4841,4842,4085,1064,3539,4591,4660,1649,4818,4662,4619,39,4647,461,4592,4828,3939,4110,4664,1970,4622,4284,4624],"extra_questions":[],"selection_lists":[1549,1558,1571,1577,1578,1627],"proposed_schedule_allowed_locations":[],"allowed_access_levels":[]},"location":{"id":546,"created":1675091697,"last_edited":1686762869,"name":"Room 15","short_name":"","description":"","location_type":"Internal","order":2,"opening_hour":0,"closing_hour":0,"class_name":"SummitVenueRoom","floor_id":0,"capacity":0,"override_blackouts":false,"venue":{"id":545,"created":1675091670,"last_edited":1675091670,"name":"Vancouver Convention Centre","short_name":"","description":"","location_type":"Internal","order":1,"opening_hour":null,"closing_hour":null,"class_name":"SummitVenue","address_1":"1055 Canada Pl","address_2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Vancouver","state":"BC","country":"CA","lng":"-123.1207375","lat":"49.2827291","website_url":"","display_on_site":false,"details_page":false,"location_message":"","is_main":true,"published_events":[25882,25883,25884],"rooms":[546,547,548,549,550,551,552,553,554,555,557,559,560,562,563,564,565,566,567,568,569,570,571,572,573,574,575,576,577,578,579]},"published_events":[25411,25468,25479,25489,25524,25529,25534,25548,25553,25558,25585,25639,25707,25728,25808,25847,25887,25891,25894,25951,25958]},"speakers":[{"id":3711,"created":1451417647,"last_edited":1655758463,"first_name":"Ghanshyam","last_name":"Mann","title":"Software Developer","bio":"<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Ghanshyam is currently serving multiple roles in OpenInfra/OpenStack Community.

While there are solutions for data at rest and data in flight, data in use is where there's a high risk of personal and sensitive information being exposed. This is where Confidential Computing comes in. With Confidential Computing, data processing can be performed in a hardware based Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). The common risk factors like the hypervisor, system admin etc cannot access data while it is inside this secure enclave. There are different technologies providers in this space with IBM Secure Execution, Intel SGX, AMD SEV etc to name a few. Goal of this presentation is to give an introduction to Confidential Computing and how OpenStack can be used by deployers to enable this technology in their Data Center. The presentation will use IBM Secure Execution based Secure Enclaves as an example to deep dive into how system administrators can manage Confidential Computing based workloads with OpenStack. </p>","social_description":"","start_date":1686855300,"end_date":1686857100,"summit_id":33,"class_name":"Presentation","allow_feedback":false,"avg_feedback_rate":0,"is_published":true,"published_date":1686312659,"head_count":0,"rsvp_link":null,"rsvp_template_id":0,"rsvp_max_user_number":0,"rsvp_max_user_wait_list_number":0,"rsvp_regular_count":0,"rsvp_wait_count":0,"rsvp_external":false,"meeting_url":"","attendance_count":0,"current_attendance_count":0,"image":null,"stream_thumbnail":null,"level":"Intermediate","created_by_id":21668,"updated_by_id":141463,"show_sponsors":false,"duration":1800,"creator_id":21668,"moderator_speaker_id":0,"selection_plan_id":19,"problem_addressed":null,"attendees_expected_learnt":"<p>Attendees can expect to get a high level overview of Confidential Computing, the security it brings in for data in use, a bit about the existing implementations currently available, basic information about how IBM Secure Execution technology works and how OpenStack can be used as the IaaS layer to manage Confidential Computing based workloads in their data center. </p>","to_record":false,"attending_media":true,"status":"Accepted","progress":"COMPLETE","selection_status":"unaccepted","disclaimer_accepted_date":null,"disclaimer_accepted":false,"custom_order":0,"attendee_votes_count":0,"rank":null,"views_count":4,"comments_count":0,"popularity_score":2,"votes_count":0,"votes_average":0,"votes_total_points":0,"track_chair_avg_score":0,"passers_count":0,"likers_count":0,"selectors_count":1,"sponsors":[],"tags":[{"id":4591,"created":1515100722,"last_edited":1515694422,"tag":"Technical"},{"id":2080,"created":1436981696,"last_edited":1525717059,"tag":"KVM"},{"id":884,"created":1434842030,"last_edited":1499285107,"tag":"Security"},{"id":4649,"created":1515695809,"last_edited":1515695809,"tag":"OpenStack"}],"feedback":[],"current_attendance":[],"type":{"id":281,"created":1661793676,"last_edited":1661793676,"name":"Lightning Talks","class_name":"PresentationType","color":"#f0f0ee","black_out_times":false,"use_sponsors":false,"are_sponsors_mandatory":false,"allows_attachment":false,"allows_level":true,"allows_publishing_dates":true,"allows_location_timeframe_collision":false,"allows_location":true,"is_default":true,"summit_id":33,"max_speakers":3,"min_speakers":1,"max_moderators":0,"min_moderators":0,"use_speakers":true,"are_speakers_mandatory":true,"use_moderator":false,"is_moderator_mandatory":false,"moderator_label":null,"should_be_available_on_cfp":true,"allow_custom_ordering":false,"allow_attendee_vote":false,"allows_speaker_event_collision":false,"summit_documents":[],"allowed_media_upload_types":[]},"track":{"id":424,"created":1662412913,"last_edited":1662412913,"name":"Public Cloud","description":"<p>Topics include: architecture / hardware, economics, cloud portability, features &amp;

Using OSTree Atomic Updates to Drastically Reduce Outage Times for Upgrades of Remote Single-Server Edge Clouds","description":"<p>In StarlingX R8.0, OSTree is used to drastically reduce outage times for upgrades of single-server edge clouds. OSTree is an upgrade system for Linux-based operating systems that performs atomic upgrades of complete filesystem trees. It is typically used for managing image updates of embedded devices.</p>\n<p>This session will provide an overview of OSTree; describe how OSTree provides git-like management of multiple versions of root fs on target, supports pre-deployment installs of upgrades of root fs while existing OS is occupying the physical /root, and supports quick deployment of upgraded root fs via hardlinks.</p>\n<p>The session then will describe the challenges and solutions to using OSTree in StarlingX cloud environment; changes to build environment, and changes to installer and patching frameworks. Finally, we will look at OSTree upgrades, delivering patches on multiple releases in parallel, and pros & cons of using OSTree on its own versus using a hybrid approach of a package manager +

Openstack plays a critical role in deployment of data centers with spine leaf architecture.

A comparative study made in a setup with OVN where BGP advertisement of learnt routes using Free Range Routing (FRR) is done with kernel and openflow routing will be presented.

supporting the most demanding applications in industrial IOT, telecommunications, video delivery and other ultra-low latency use cases. The platform is an implementation of the LOKI stack, as it creates a fusion between well known open source projects including the Linux kernel, OpenStack and Kubernetes. And, the StarlingX project is currently celebrating its 5th year anniversary!<br />\n</p>\n<p>This Forum session will explore the platform’s evolution throughout the past 5 years, and take a closer look at the use cases that the project is already being used or applicable for.

Data Sovereignty of OpenStack operated Clouds with Gaia-X Self-Descriptions","description":"<p>You are willing to use an OpenStack public cloud as a customer? Great! But wait - how about data sovereignty? How to ensure, that your data is processed according to technical or legal regulations that your business or your own customers require? OpenStack will not do this for you and providers may use proprietary formats. In this context, <a href=\"https://gaia-x.eu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><u>Gaia-X</u></a> develops a federated open data infrastructure based on European values regarding data sovereignty. Self-Descriptions and Trust Framework are core elements. Self-Descriptions provide a standardized, machine-executable vocabulary to describe different aspects of service and data processing. Trust Framework defines guidelines for use of that vocabulary.

everyday activities to make impactful decisions, there are growing concerns about trustworthiness. It's of utmost importance to have fairer interpretable models to make decisions in healthcare, finances, the justice system, etc. This presentation aims to predict biases earlier enough in a multi-class and multi-label problem before they can induce harm. The distributed nature of online communities and their complex data sources makes it difficult to identify biases in data. Thus, we use large language models to accurately classify textual/images/video data across languages, cultures, religions, ages, genders, etc. Also, we fine-tune a transformer (BERT) to predict complicated NLP tasks, which traditional machine learning models would be limited. A typical BERT model can contextually generate text embedding for a multi-class problem and task-specific classification embedding. Our result predicts biases with an accuracy of 98.7%</p>","social_description":"Large language models such as BERT can effectively prevent online communities from toxicity and bias","start_date":1686867600,"end_date":1686869400,"summit_id":33,"class_name":"Presentation","allow_feedback":false,"avg_feedback_rate":0,"is_published":true,"published_date":1675112875,"head_count":0,"rsvp_link":null,"rsvp_template_id":0,"rsvp_max_user_number":0,"rsvp_max_user_wait_list_number":0,"rsvp_regular_count":0,"rsvp_wait_count":0,"rsvp_external":false,"meeting_url":"","attendance_count":0,"current_attendance_count":0,"image":null,"stream_thumbnail":null,"level":"Advanced","created_by_id":34436,"updated_by_id":141463,"show_sponsors":false,"duration":1800,"creator_id":34436,"moderator_speaker_id":0,"selection_plan_id":19,"problem_addressed":null,"attendees_expected_learnt":"<p>The <strong>attendees</strong> are expected to learn how large language models (<strong>LLM</strong>) work, the different methods in training these models and more specific NLP models such as BERTs, and the use cases suitable for such models.

unified and scalable deployment of clusters, configurations and applications","description":"<p>Arlon is a new open source project that unifies the deployment of Kubernetes clusters, configurations and applications through a single declarative API. Arlon builds upon existing innovations in the areas of infrastructure APIs and gitops; in particular, it allows a user to define cluster templates using Cluster API or Crossplane manifests, then group commonly used apps and settings using \"profiles\". Manifests and profiles are combined to deploy multiple clusters, which are populated as specified by the profiles. All of this is achieved in one step based on git principles. Arlon solves 3 problems: unification of infrastructure and app definitions, large-scale deployment and updates, and standardization of add-ons for production-ready clusters. This talk first describes the architecture behind Arlon, then demonstrates how the tool can help administer large scale fleets of clusters and applications across many datacenters and geographies.</p>","social_description":"Arlon is a new open source project that unifies the deployment of Kubernetes clusters, configuration","start_date":1686870000,"end_date":1686871800,"summit_id":33,"class_name":"Presentation","allow_feedback":false,"avg_feedback_rate":0,"is_published":true,"published_date":1675096409,"head_count":0,"rsvp_link":null,"rsvp_template_id":0,"rsvp_max_user_number":0,"rsvp_max_user_wait_list_number":0,"rsvp_regular_count":0,"rsvp_wait_count":0,"rsvp_external":false,"meeting_url":null,"attendance_count":0,"current_attendance_count":0,"image":null,"stream_thumbnail":null,"level":"Intermediate","created_by_id":29010,"updated_by_id":141463,"show_sponsors":false,"duration":1800,"creator_id":29010,"moderator_speaker_id":0,"selection_plan_id":19,"problem_addressed":null,"attendees_expected_learnt":"<p>This talk should be most valuable for any member of a devops or platform engineering team, especially one tasked with managing dozens or hundreds of Kubernetes clusters, possibly spread over multiple clouds, datacenters, and/or locations.

One major area where the need for more sovereignty is immense is the cloud space. The dependency on hyperscalers is still far too high - often because companies and the public sector lack both suitable tools and knowledge for setting up and operating their own cloud infrastructure. This is where ALASCA comes in - our newly founded non-profit association for operational, open cloud infrastructures. ALASCA's mission is twofold: First, we develop open source technologies (such as our Lifecycle Management Tool for OpenStack Yaook) that are ready for application. Second, we raise awareness, educate and provide concrete guidance for using our tools, so that organizations can overcome the hurdles for the deployment of their own cloud. This way, ALASCA not only sends a signal for digital sovereignty, but also creates a real, strong contribution.</p>","social_description":"ALASCA is taking up the challenge of \"digital sovereignty\" by working on open source projects for op","start_date":1686870000,"end_date":1686871800,"summit_id":33,"class_name":"Presentation","allow_feedback":false,"avg_feedback_rate":0,"is_published":true,"published_date":1684500963,"head_count":0,"rsvp_link":null,"rsvp_template_id":0,"rsvp_max_user_number":0,"rsvp_max_user_wait_list_number":0,"rsvp_regular_count":0,"rsvp_wait_count":0,"rsvp_external":false,"meeting_url":"","attendance_count":0,"current_attendance_count":0,"image":null,"stream_thumbnail":null,"level":"Beginner","created_by_id":145359,"updated_by_id":141463,"show_sponsors":false,"duration":1800,"creator_id":145359,"moderator_speaker_id":0,"selection_plan_id":19,"problem_addressed":null,"attendees_expected_learnt":"<p>Although we encounter the topic of digital sovereignty frequently in our daily lives, it is often not clear at all what we are dealing with - and why the matter is so vitally important in the first place.

Observability  revamped","description":"<p>OpenStack scales to incredible sizes. However, that makes it more and more important and at the same time more difficult to know what’s happening on the deployment. Debugging becomes a challenge and even more growing with the size of the infrastructure. Current OpenStack Telemetry has proven its capabilities so far. But it has also shown its limitations. When the OpenStack projects ceilometer, aodh, panko and back then OpenStack Gnocchi were started, they were more or less without competition. That changed with newer CNCF projects like prometheus, OpenMetrics, OpenTelemetry, etc., and the proposed talk will show how that’ll work. Some aspects of observability, like collecting logs, have not been considered as part of the OpenStack ecosystem. However, having a central log collection is hugely helpful and will be covered.</p>\n<p>This talk would fit for the public and for the private cloud tracks; if the private infrastructure track is full, it could be shifted to the public cloud track.</p>","social_description":"Observability for OpenStack services - what we can do now, what to expect in the future and what’s p","start_date":1686872400,"end_date":1686874200,"summit_id":33,"class_name":"Presentation","allow_feedback":false,"avg_feedback_rate":0,"is_published":true,"published_date":1675096154,"head_count":0,"rsvp_link":null,"rsvp_template_id":0,"rsvp_max_user_number":0,"rsvp_max_user_wait_list_number":0,"rsvp_regular_count":0,"rsvp_wait_count":0,"rsvp_external":false,"meeting_url":null,"attendance_count":0,"current_attendance_count":0,"image":null,"stream_thumbnail":null,"level":"Intermediate","created_by_id":5990,"updated_by_id":141463,"show_sponsors":false,"duration":1800,"creator_id":5990,"moderator_speaker_id":0,"selection_plan_id":19,"problem_addressed":null,"attendees_expected_learnt":"<p>We will describe the OpenStack Telemetry stack and how one would use it on a large deployment.</p>\n<p>Since the initial implementation and now that a couple of new competitors came into play, we’ll show how especially larger OpenStack deployments can benefit from using different tools; the talk will also describe what needs to be done and what could be gained by doing the work.
