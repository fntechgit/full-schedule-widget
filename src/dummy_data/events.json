This re-distribution of computation is giving rise to an integrated and fast-growing IT ecosystem where computational capability and capacity are placed near where they are needed. At the root of this shift are applications that need to seamlessly integrate into real-time business processes and leisure activities, which can require very low latency response times and rapid processing of very large AI and ML data sets. A rapidly growing IT ecosystem threatens to consume alarming amounts of resources and make a significant contribution to carbon emissions, driving the need for adoption of more sustainable methods for data centers. This keynote will detail these three trends and outline areas where innovation is needed in IT ecosystems for distributed computation, composable silicon for workload diversity and power management and cooling for sustainability.</p>","social_description":"","start_date":1636395300,"end_date":1636396200,"summit_id":31,"class_name":"Presentation","allow_feedback":false,"avg_feedback_rate":0,"is_published":true,"head_count":0,"rsvp_link":null,"rsvp_template_id":0,"rsvp_max_user_number":0,"rsvp_max_user_wait_list_number":0,"rsvp_regular_count":0,"rsvp_wait_count":0,"rsvp_external":false,"meeting_url":"","attendance_count":130,"current_attendance_count":47,"image":null,"stream_thumbnail":"https://image.mux.com/nmK018oB4KNpqSx01VP81cFrYsntc3svk9NLveJ2fjLJM/thumbnail.jpg","level":"N/A","created_by_id":27731,"updated_by_id":27695,"show_sponsors":false,"creator_id":27731,"moderator_speaker_id":0,"selection_plan_id":21,"problem_addressed":null,"attendees_expected_learnt":"","to_record":true,"attending_media":false,"status":"Accepted","progress":"COMPLETE","selection_status":"unaccepted","disclaimer_accepted_date":1630674503,"disclaimer_accepted":true,"rank":0,"sponsors":[],"tags":[],"feedback":[],"current_attendance":[{"id":157231,"created":1636397260,"last_edited":1636397260,"member_first_name":"Lucas","member_last_name":"Yeary","member_pic":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d58f1e2088060728490ddc7db047f5c4","type":"EVENT","ip":"165.225.220.255","origin":"https://2021ocpglobal.fnvirtual.app","browser":"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0;

The architecture is highly modular and scalable.  The series-connected switched-capacitor circuits split high input voltage into multiple stacked low voltage domains. The parallel-connected multiphase buck circuits distribute high output current into multiple low current paths.  A 780 A vertical stacked microprocessor voltage regulator with a peak efficiency of 91.1% and a full load efficiency of 79.2% at an output voltage of 1 V with liquid cooling is built and tested. This is the first demonstration of a 48 V-1 V microprocessor voltage regulator achieving over 1 A/mm2 current density and 1,000 W/in3 power density.</p>","display_on_site":true,"featured":false,"order":7,"presentation_id":2147,"class_name":"PresentationSlide","link":"https://object-storage.public.mtl1.vexxhost.net/swift/v1/6e4619c416ff4bd19e1c087f27a43eea/assets-fn/summits/31/presentations/2147/slides/OCP21G-Symposium-Poster-Jaeil-Baek-e1b68f6ecfc1c7e15f136f6a8fb41c55-58e8e3b2295d6809eb0fc08ae73bbe69.pdf","has_file":true}],"public_comments":[],"links":[{"id":2659,"created":1630628864,"last_edited":1630628864,"name":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9487080","description":"<p> </p>","display_on_site":false,"featured":false,"order":2,"presentation_id":2147,"class_name":"PresentationLink","link":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9487080"},{"id":2660,"created":1630628898,"last_edited":1630628898,"name":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9236294","description":"<p> </p>","display_on_site":false,"featured":false,"order":3,"presentation_id":2147,"class_name":"PresentationLink","link":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9236294"},{"id":2661,"created":1630628929,"last_edited":1630628929,"name":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9124564","description":"<p> </p>","display_on_site":false,"featured":false,"order":4,"presentation_id":2147,"class_name":"PresentationLink","link":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9124564"},{"id":2662,"created":1630628959,"last_edited":1630628959,"name":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8769631","description":"<p> </p>","display_on_site":false,"featured":false,"order":5,"presentation_id":2147,"class_name":"PresentationLink","link":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8769631"},{"id":2663,"created":1630628997,"last_edited":1630628997,"name":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSH0gXtfADE","description":"<p> </p>","display_on_site":false,"featured":false,"order":6,"presentation_id":2147,"class_name":"PresentationLink","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSH0gXtfADE"}],"videos":[],"media_uploads":[{"id":2658,"created":1630628836,"last_edited":1630628836,"display_on_site":false,"order":1,"presentation_id":2147,"class_name":"PresentationMediaUpload","filename":"JaeilBaek-OCP21-394df7ad998d4292a0bcae14870ba35d-9b2d8dc55fca07d4af5eb177fdf6903f.pdf","media_upload_type_id":23,"name":"Abstract PDF","description":"This is the IEEE abstract you submitted.

To fulfill this need Samsung proposes DSS storage solution, which implements object Key-Value API on top NVMeOF SSD. The support of storage remote access protocols facilitates the disaggregation. Therefore, storage can be easily scaled. Besides object storage support and scalability, our architecture can provision the bandwidth demands for each application on each client server. This paper introduces our DSS Storage systems that support high-bandwidth per capacity for object-format data with an effortlessly scale-up feature.

To fulfill this need Samsung proposes DSS storage solution, which implements object Key-Value API on top NVMeOF SSD. The support of storage remote access protocols facilitates the disaggregation. Therefore, storage can be easily scaled. Besides object storage support and scalability, our architecture can provision the bandwidth demands for each application on each client server. This paper introduces our DSS Storage systems that support high-bandwidth per capacity for object-format data with an effortlessly scale-up feature.

Telescent has developed the Network Topology Manager (NTM), a 1000 x 1000 robotic cross-connect. This device can connect, disconnect, and reconnect fibers in an arbitrary manner. A key feature is this device enables test equipment to be automatically switched into a given fiber link to enable characterization of fiber performance. Power sources, power monitors and OTDRs are examples of equipment that may be incorporated into the NTM, permitting in-situ fiber characterization to take place without human intervention. Since the NTM can insert a range of test equipment, Layer 2 and 3 test equipment can also be inserted to monitor traffic.

Hall Talk - Building The ZNS Ecosystem: A Community Effort - Presented by Samsung","description":"<p>The ZNS (Zoned Namespace) interface imposes significant modifications to the traditional block interface used to access SSDs.   Although these interface additions support leaner controller designs, it comes at a cost of not being a drop-in replacement for block-based storage software. The ecosystem changes needed to support ZNS are well beyond the scope of a single storage vendor. In this presentation, Samsung will share some of our key learnings concerning ZNS ecosystem development, particularly the enabling of ZNS in RocksDB.   Furthermore, we will discuss a storage abstraction we have developed that can serve as a foundation for ZNS-compatible software. Finally, we will invite attendees to collaborate in further development around ZNS software so the entire industry can enjoy the many benefits of ZNS.    </p>","social_description":"","start_date":1636493400,"end_date":1636494300,"summit_id":31,"class_name":"Presentation","allow_feedback":false,"avg_feedback_rate":0,"is_published":true,"head_count":0,"rsvp_link":null,"rsvp_template_id":0,"rsvp_max_user_number":0,"rsvp_max_user_wait_list_number":0,"rsvp_regular_count":0,"rsvp_wait_count":0,"rsvp_external":false,"meeting_url":"","attendance_count":0,"current_attendance_count":0,"image":null,"stream_thumbnail":"https://image.mux.com/kHyRzW4vxmft85nae01rldy00Fchh01GYPk02y5LnPF300CQ/thumbnail.jpg","level":null,"created_by_id":27748,"updated_by_id":27695,"show_sponsors":true,"creator_id":27748,"moderator_speaker_id":0,"selection_plan_id":0,"problem_addressed":null,"attendees_expected_learnt":"","to_record":true,"attending_media":false,"status":"Accepted","progress":"COMPLETE","selection_status":"unaccepted","disclaimer_accepted_date":null,"disclaimer_accepted":false,"rank":0,"sponsors":[{"id":40,"created":1629850305,"last_edited":1629850305,"name":"Samsung","url":"","display_on_site":false,"featured":false,"city":"","state":"","country":"","description":"","industry":"","contributions":"","contact_email":"","member_level":"None","admin_email":"","overview":"","products":"","commitment":"","commitment_author":"","logo":"https://object-storage.public.mtl1.vexxhost.net/swift/v1/6e4619c416ff4bd19e1c087f27a43eea/assets-fn/companies/40/logos/OCP21GLO-SessionBrandingBar-Sponsor-Samsung4.png","big_logo":"https://object-storage.public.mtl1.vexxhost.net/swift/v1/6e4619c416ff4bd19e1c087f27a43eea/assets-fn/companies/40/logos/OCP21GLO-SessionBrandingBar-Sponsor-Samsung3.png","color":"#DADADA","sponsorships":[1876,1877,2099,2117],"project_sponsorships":[]}],"tags":[],"feedback":[],"current_attendance":[],"type":{"id":417,"created":1628269224,"last_edited":1628269224,"name":"Sponsor Presentation","class_name":"PresentationType","color":"#f0f0ee","black_out_times":false,"use_sponsors":true,"are_sponsors_mandatory":false,"allows_attachment":false,"allows_level":false,"is_default":false,"summit_id":31,"max_speakers":0,"min_speakers":0,"max_moderators":0,"min_moderators":0,"use_speakers":true,"are_speakers_mandatory":false,"use_moderator":false,"is_moderator_mandatory":false,"moderator_label":"","should_be_available_on_cfp":false,"summit_documents":[],"allowed_media_upload_types":[18,31]},"track":{"id":36011,"created":1627756590,"last_edited":1627756590,"name":"Expo Hall Talk","description":"<p>Expo Hall Talks presented by Sponsors</p>","code":"EHT","slug":"expo-hall-talk","session_count":100,"alternate_count":0,"lightning_count":0,"lightning_alternate_count":0,"voting_visible":false,"chair_visible":false,"summit_id":31,"color":"#ff9c00","icon_url":null,"track_groups":[32],"allowed_tags":[60],"extra_questions":[],"selection_lists":[],"allowed_access_levels":[]},"location":{"id":216,"created":1613066981,"last_edited":1613066981,"name":"Hall 1","short_name":null,"description":"<p>Expo&nbsp;</p>","location_type":"Internal","order":8,"class_name":"SummitVenueRoom","capacity":1000,"override_blackouts":true,"venue":{"id":209,"created":1613066436,"last_edited":1613066436,"name":"SJCC","short_name":"San Jose McEnery Convention Center","description":"<p>The San Jose McEnery Convention Center sits in the center of Downtown and boasts hundreds of varied events a year.

Network administrators typically have no visibility into these flows, increasing the difficulty of ensuring network and application performance. </p>\n<p>This talk reviews innovative approaches to simplifying Kubernetes networking and enhancing visibility from application flows through the overlay to the physical underlay network. We review how switch-based, line-rate flow monitoring can provide full visibility into application flows within and between Kubernetes clusters, including session duration, data transfer and end to end latency. We then discuss mechanisms to extend this deep application visibility into servers and into public cloud environments for full visibility across a hybrid multi-cloud environment.</p>","social_description":"The new edge requires a hybrid overlay fabric and SmartNICs to meet emerging requirements","start_date":1636498800,"end_date":1636500300,"summit_id":31,"class_name":"Presentation","allow_feedback":false,"avg_feedback_rate":0,"is_published":true,"head_count":0,"rsvp_link":null,"rsvp_template_id":0,"rsvp_max_user_number":0,"rsvp_max_user_wait_list_number":0,"rsvp_regular_count":0,"rsvp_wait_count":0,"rsvp_external":false,"meeting_url":"","attendance_count":0,"current_attendance_count":0,"image":null,"stream_thumbnail":"https://image.mux.com/SqsolWtPofrxL5xrXD8J51GI01wJusTl4uKlj4qQ6WYg/thumbnail.jpg","level":"Intermediate","created_by_id":31080,"updated_by_id":27695,"show_sponsors":false,"creator_id":31080,"moderator_speaker_id":0,"selection_plan_id":21,"problem_addressed":null,"attendees_expected_learnt":"","to_record":true,"attending_media":true,"status":"Accepted","progress":"COMPLETE","selection_status":"unaccepted","disclaimer_accepted_date":1627055846,"disclaimer_accepted":true,"rank":0,"sponsors":[{"id":89,"created":1631653411,"last_edited":1631653411,"name":"Pluribus Networks","url":"","display_on_site":false,"featured":false,"city":"","state":"","country":"","description":"","industry":"","contributions":"","contact_email":"","member_level":"None","admin_email":"","overview":"","products":"","commitment":"","commitment_author":"","logo":"https://object-storage.public.mtl1.vexxhost.net/swift/v1/6e4619c416ff4bd19e1c087f27a43eea/assets-fn/companies/89/logos/OCP21GLO-SessionBrandingBar-Sponsor-Pluribus.png","big_logo":null,"color":"#DADADA","sponsorships":[2338,1890],"project_sponsorships":[]}],"tags":[],"feedback":[],"current_attendance":[],"type":{"id":371,"created":1613066057,"last_edited":1613066057,"name":"Presentation","class_name":"PresentationType","color":"#f0f0ee","black_out_times":false,"use_sponsors":true,"are_sponsors_mandatory":false,"allows_attachment":false,"allows_level":true,"is_default":true,"summit_id":31,"max_speakers":3,"min_speakers":1,"max_moderators":1,"min_moderators":0,"use_speakers":true,"are_speakers_mandatory":true,"use_moderator":true,"is_moderator_mandatory":false,"moderator_label":"","should_be_available_on_cfp":true,"summit_documents":[20],"allowed_media_upload_types":[18,31]},"track":{"id":36037,"created":1632256003,"last_edited":1632256003,"name":"OCP Solution Provider Use Cases","description":"<p>Solution&nbsp;Provider&nbsp;Use&nbsp;Cases</p>","code":"SPUC","slug":"ocp-solution-provider-use-cases","session_count":5,"alternate_count":0,"lightning_count":0,"lightning_alternate_count":0,"voting_visible":false,"chair_visible":false,"summit_id":31,"color":"#daa043","icon_url":null,"track_groups":[32],"allowed_tags":[60],"extra_questions":[],"selection_lists":[],"allowed_access_levels":[]},"location":{"id":221,"created":1613067244,"last_edited":1613067244,"name":"210CG","short_name":"","description":"<p>Executive Talks &amp; Engineering Workshops</p>","location_type":"Internal","order":13,"class_name":"SummitVenueRoom","capacity":300,"override_blackouts":false,"venue":{"id":209,"created":1613066436,"last_edited":1613066436,"name":"SJCC","short_name":"San Jose McEnery Convention Center","description":"<p>The San Jose McEnery Convention Center sits in the center of Downtown and boasts hundreds of varied events a year.

Most companies making the shift to hybrid clouds, containers and Kubernetes are seeking a range of productivity improvements, resource efficiency, portability and increased scalability. For years, the largest hyperscale cloud providers have been driving significantly better results and operational savings from both their hardware and software stacks by adopting open hardware architecture alongside open source software. Now these gains are readily available to enterprise and hybrid cloud computing customers everywhere. We will address how hardware-plus-software solutions using high- density and high-efficiency OCP hardware, software-defined storage and software-defined networking enable hybrid cloud Kubernetes clusters. With the addition of Azure ARC and Google Anthos, these solutions straddle public and private clouds in a flexible way, all managed from a coherent set of self-service dashboards.</p>","social_description":"","start_date":1636504200,"end_date":1636505700,"summit_id":31,"class_name":"Presentation","allow_feedback":false,"avg_feedback_rate":0,"is_published":true,"head_count":0,"rsvp_link":null,"rsvp_template_id":0,"rsvp_max_user_number":0,"rsvp_max_user_wait_list_number":0,"rsvp_regular_count":0,"rsvp_wait_count":0,"rsvp_external":false,"meeting_url":"","attendance_count":6,"current_attendance_count":1,"image":null,"stream_thumbnail":"https://image.mux.com/SqsolWtPofrxL5xrXD8J51GI01wJusTl4uKlj4qQ6WYg/thumbnail.jpg","level":"Beginner","created_by_id":30971,"updated_by_id":27695,"show_sponsors":false,"creator_id":30971,"moderator_speaker_id":0,"selection_plan_id":21,"problem_addressed":null,"attendees_expected_learnt":"","to_record":true,"attending_media":true,"status":"Accepted","progress":"COMPLETE","selection_status":"unaccepted","disclaimer_accepted_date":1627057539,"disclaimer_accepted":true,"rank":0,"sponsors":[{"id":39,"created":1629850271,"last_edited":1629850271,"name":"ITRenew","url":"","display_on_site":false,"featured":false,"city":"","state":"","country":"","description":"","industry":"","contributions":"","contact_email":"","member_level":"None","admin_email":"","overview":"","products":"","commitment":"","commitment_author":"","logo":"https://object-storage.public.mtl1.vexxhost.net/swift/v1/6e4619c416ff4bd19e1c087f27a43eea/assets-fn/companies/39/logos/OCP21GLO-SessionBrandingBar-Sponsor-ITRenew5.png","big_logo":"https://object-storage.public.mtl1.vexxhost.net/swift/v1/6e4619c416ff4bd19e1c087f27a43eea/assets-fn/companies/39/logos/OCP21GLO-SessionBrandingBar-Sponsor-ITRenew4.png","color":"#DADADA","sponsorships":[2337,2276,1766,1827,1879,1893,1896,1905,2013,2110,2097],"project_sponsorships":[]}],"tags":[],"feedback":[],"current_attendance":[{"id":129470,"created":1635197383,"last_edited":1635197383,"member_first_name":"Clint","member_last_name":"Espinoza","member_pic":"https://object-storage.public.mtl1.vexxhost.net/swift/v1/6e4619c416ff4bd19e1c087f27a43eea/idp-fn/profile_pics/Clint-Espinoza-2013.jpg","type":"EVENT","ip":"104.181.155.90","origin":"https://2021ocpglobal.fnvirtual.app","browser":"Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 14_8 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/14.1.2 Mobile/15E148 Safari/604.1","outgress_date":null,"ingress_date":1635197383,"event_id":1896}],"type":{"id":371,"created":1613066057,"last_edited":1613066057,"name":"Presentation","class_name":"PresentationType","color":"#f0f0ee","black_out_times":false,"use_sponsors":true,"are_sponsors_mandatory":false,"allows_attachment":false,"allows_level":true,"is_default":true,"summit_id":31,"max_speakers":3,"min_speakers":1,"max_moderators":1,"min_moderators":0,"use_speakers":true,"are_speakers_mandatory":true,"use_moderator":true,"is_moderator_mandatory":false,"moderator_label":"","should_be_available_on_cfp":true,"summit_documents":[20],"allowed_media_upload_types":[18,31]},"track":{"id":36037,"created":1632256003,"last_edited":1632256003,"name":"OCP Solution Provider Use Cases","description":"<p>Solution&nbsp;Provider&nbsp;Use&nbsp;Cases</p>","code":"SPUC","slug":"ocp-solution-provider-use-cases","session_count":5,"alternate_count":0,"lightning_count":0,"lightning_alternate_count":0,"voting_visible":false,"chair_visible":false,"summit_id":31,"color":"#daa043","icon_url":null,"track_groups":[32],"allowed_tags":[60],"extra_questions":[],"selection_lists":[],"allowed_access_levels":[]},"location":{"id":221,"created":1613067244,"last_edited":1613067244,"name":"210CG","short_name":"","description":"<p>Executive Talks &amp; Engineering Workshops</p>","location_type":"Internal","order":13,"class_name":"SummitVenueRoom","capacity":300,"override_blackouts":false,"venue":{"id":209,"created":1613066436,"last_edited":1613066436,"name":"SJCC","short_name":"San Jose McEnery Convention Center","description":"<p>The San Jose McEnery Convention Center sits in the center of Downtown and boasts hundreds of varied events a year.

For example, at the 2019 OCP Summit, the Modular Building Block Architecture defined a datacenter-ready secure control module (DC-SCM) and a host processor and memory module. Since   then, we have contributed the DC-SCM 1.0 spec, and a subgroup under the Hardware Management Project is pursuing DC-SCM 2.0 spec. During this Executive Talk, based on DC-SCM, we will introduce a datacenter-ready modular hardware system and a modular software architecture (Hyperstack) to form a datacenter-ready integrated system stack (DC-Stack).

Application performance requirements on the one hand and cost and TCO constraints on the other dictate the feasibility of chiplet architectures. In this talk, we will explore current and emerging HPC and Machine Learning applications and algorithms , their performance requirements and the constraints imposed on the chiplet architectures. In general, standard benchmarks like SpecRate can only provide partial guidance to chiplet architectures at best. Emerging algorithms with features like sparsity can impose stronger latency and bandwidth requirements at the node level and system level which in turn pass these requirements to chiplet architectures.</p>","social_description":"Application performance and TCO dictate Chiplet Architectures","start_date":1636560900,"end_date":1636561800,"summit_id":31,"class_name":"Presentation","allow_feedback":false,"avg_feedback_rate":0,"is_published":true,"head_count":0,"rsvp_link":null,"rsvp_template_id":0,"rsvp_max_user_number":0,"rsvp_max_user_wait_list_number":0,"rsvp_regular_count":0,"rsvp_wait_count":0,"rsvp_external":false,"meeting_url":"","attendance_count":2,"current_attendance_count":0,"image":null,"stream_thumbnail":"https://image.mux.com/BqZB9rV02k6ESXzEJgDqgJUACgvDfjZ6L02TW1TKWCSQ00/thumbnail.jpg","level":"Intermediate","created_by_id":31193,"updated_by_id":27695,"show_sponsors":false,"creator_id":31193,"moderator_speaker_id":0,"selection_plan_id":18,"problem_addressed":null,"attendees_expected_learnt":"<p>Attendees are expected to get a broader view of feasibility of Chiplets in HPC and Machine Learning Application domain.

Join ITRenew, who’s circular, sustainable infrastructure approach is eliminating the 75% of pre-use carbon tied to IT globally. And EcoDataCenter, the Swedish pioneers behind the world’s first climate positive data center. They’ll discuss new solutions turning once-aspirational targets into industry standards for companies like Green AI Cloud (how about net CO2 savings of 100+ grams of carbon/kWh?).

Lastly, will discuss the test challenges of achieving high and predictable KGD on Chiplets that make it much more difficult than a monolithic die/package. A single bad Chiplet in a SiP with many other good Chiplets will lead to a bad SiP and consequently a high scrap cost.

We are proposing our third generation of Yosemite platform that builds on the modular architecture to supports these different workloads, power requirements and varying silicon designs without separate hardware design for each. A common base architecture can use expansion options to customize the solution for each of the many applications. These modular one-socket servers marks a significant improvement in increased modularity, serviceability and a general improvement in volume optimization.

These workloads often exhibit a \"scatter-gather\" or \"partition-aggregate\" communication pattern, for which effects of hash imbalance and TCP incasts become factors impacting the JCT. In our research on these dependencies, we realized that emulating behaviors of complex systems such that of a datacenter is an entirely new problem to solve. We decided to build a datacenter workload simulator, allowing us to do system level experiments and iterate quickly.</p>\n<p>In this talk we will share our journey to build a realistic test setup, which was inspired by the OCP2020 \"Bringing the F16 Network into the Lab\" tech demo. This approach enabled us to streamline system experiments, and led us to work on an open data model describing network topologies and complex traffic patterns. We’d like to introduce these models to the OCP community and initiate their collaborative development.</p>","social_description":"","start_date":1636565100,"end_date":1636566600,"summit_id":31,"class_name":"Presentation","allow_feedback":false,"avg_feedback_rate":0,"is_published":true,"head_count":0,"rsvp_link":null,"rsvp_template_id":0,"rsvp_max_user_number":0,"rsvp_max_user_wait_list_number":0,"rsvp_regular_count":0,"rsvp_wait_count":0,"rsvp_external":false,"meeting_url":"","attendance_count":1,"current_attendance_count":0,"image":null,"stream_thumbnail":"https://image.mux.com/yw6VdQECicpi9tQkgLQ73yvDRkD2Axa005qk5DztshLc/thumbnail.jpg","level":"Advanced","created_by_id":30314,"updated_by_id":27695,"show_sponsors":false,"creator_id":30314,"moderator_speaker_id":0,"selection_plan_id":18,"problem_addressed":null,"attendees_expected_learnt":"<p>This talk would be relevant to those who are developing innovative DPUs, comparing Clos topologies, need to better understand buffer pressure, experiment with QoS and ultimately, estimate impact of the networking on ML/HPC job completion time.</p>","to_record":true,"attending_media":true,"status":"Accepted","progress":"COMPLETE","selection_status":"accepted","disclaimer_accepted_date":1626387961,"disclaimer_accepted":true,"rank":6,"sponsors":[{"id":66,"created":1629874554,"last_edited":1629874554,"name":"Keysight Technologies","url":"","display_on_site":false,"featured":false,"city":"","state":"","country":"","description":"","industry":"","contributions":"","contact_email":"","member_level":"None","admin_email":"","overview":"","products":"","commitment":"","commitment_author":"","logo":"https://object-storage.public.mtl1.vexxhost.net/swift/v1/6e4619c416ff4bd19e1c087f27a43eea/assets-fn/companies/66/logos/OCP21GLO-SessionBrandingBar-Sponsor-Keysight.png","big_logo":null,"color":"#DADADA","sponsorships":[2324,1737,1809],"project_sponsorships":[]}],"tags":[],"feedback":[],"current_attendance":[],"type":{"id":371,"created":1613066057,"last_edited":1613066057,"name":"Presentation","class_name":"PresentationType","color":"#f0f0ee","black_out_times":false,"use_sponsors":true,"are_sponsors_mandatory":false,"allows_attachment":false,"allows_level":true,"is_default":true,"summit_id":31,"max_speakers":3,"min_speakers":1,"max_moderators":1,"min_moderators":0,"use_speakers":true,"are_speakers_mandatory":true,"use_moderator":true,"is_moderator_mandatory":false,"moderator_label":"","should_be_available_on_cfp":true,"summit_documents":[20],"allowed_media_upload_types":[18,31]},"track":{"id":35993,"created":1618866603,"last_edited":1618866603,"name":"EW: Networking","description":"<p>Networking hardware and software deployed into data centers, telecom central offices and enterprise.</p>\n<p>Includes Sub-Projects: Enterprise Connectivity Solutions (ECS), Open Network Linux (ONL), Open Network Install Environment (ONIE), SONiC</p>","code":"EW9","slug":"ew-networking","session_count":24,"alternate_count":5,"lightning_count":0,"lightning_alternate_count":0,"voting_visible":false,"chair_visible":true,"summit_id":31,"color":"#b2f8f8","icon_url":null,"track_groups":[31,32],"allowed_tags":[60],"extra_questions":[],"selection_lists":[224,225,254,265,280,281,295,298,356,371,391,407,443,450,456,466,515,523],"allowed_access_levels":[{"id":96,"created":1627866697,"last_edited":1627866697,"name":"VIRTUAL-ALL","description":"Allows access to all areas of the virtual event","template_content":"","is_default":false,"summit_id":31}]},"location":{"id":234,"created":1613067923,"last_edited":1613067923,"name":"LL20A","short_name":"","description":"<p>Symposium &amp; Engineering Workshop</p>","location_type":"Internal","order":26,"class_name":"SummitVenueRoom","capacity":200,"override_blackouts":false,"venue":{"id":209,"created":1613066436,"last_edited":1613066436,"name":"SJCC","short_name":"San Jose McEnery Convention Center","description":"<p>The San Jose McEnery Convention Center sits in the center of Downtown and boasts hundreds of varied events a year.

Here, each network node is locked to an upstream timing reference, or Grandmaster (GM), whose time is derived from GPS. When the GM loses lock to GPS, the GM enters a state of holdover where a local oscillator maintains network synchronization for a limited time. Since there’s no universal specification for holdover, proper oscillator selection can be challenging and lead to sub-optimal PTP performance. A key goal of the OCP-TAP Oscillator Workstream is to specify time holdover for different classes of oscillators corresponding to different use cases in a data center. This talk presents a model used for this classification that accounts for various noise processes during holdover. A test methodology is also presented to ensure oscillators comply with holdover specifications.</p>","social_description":"This talk discusses holdover requirements for a data center, including a model and test methodology","start_date":1636565100,"end_date":1636566600,"summit_id":31,"class_name":"Presentation","allow_feedback":false,"avg_feedback_rate":0,"is_published":true,"head_count":0,"rsvp_link":null,"rsvp_template_id":0,"rsvp_max_user_number":0,"rsvp_max_user_wait_list_number":0,"rsvp_regular_count":0,"rsvp_wait_count":0,"rsvp_external":false,"meeting_url":"","attendance_count":0,"current_attendance_count":0,"image":null,"stream_thumbnail":"https://image.mux.com/eBzMKVBZfmveJ4ZOsnv2vAfVUHA1VOAkNIUIqkH9sWA/thumbnail.jpg","level":"Intermediate","created_by_id":28072,"updated_by_id":27695,"show_sponsors":false,"creator_id":28072,"moderator_speaker_id":0,"selection_plan_id":18,"problem_addressed":null,"attendees_expected_learnt":"<p>- What are the holdover test parameters specified for oscillators by the OCP-TAP Oscillator Workstream</p>\n<p>- Overview of model for time holdover considering different noise sources present in an oscillator</p>\n<p>- How to compute max time error for holdover</p>","to_record":true,"attending_media":false,"status":"Accepted","progress":"COMPLETE","selection_status":"accepted","disclaimer_accepted_date":1627002875,"disclaimer_accepted":true,"rank":4,"sponsors":[],"tags":[{"id":60,"created":1634321379,"last_edited":1634321379,"tag":"vod"}],"feedback":[],"current_attendance":[],"type":{"id":371,"created":1613066057,"last_edited":1613066057,"name":"Presentation","class_name":"PresentationType","color":"#f0f0ee","black_out_times":false,"use_sponsors":true,"are_sponsors_mandatory":false,"allows_attachment":false,"allows_level":true,"is_default":true,"summit_id":31,"max_speakers":3,"min_speakers":1,"max_moderators":1,"min_moderators":0,"use_speakers":true,"are_speakers_mandatory":true,"use_moderator":true,"is_moderator_mandatory":false,"moderator_label":"","should_be_available_on_cfp":true,"summit_documents":[20],"allowed_media_upload_types":[18,31]},"track":{"id":35998,"created":1618866603,"last_edited":1618866603,"name":"EW: Time Appliances Project (TAP)","description":"<p>Aims to bring together the community of datacenter operators, application developers, and equipment and semiconductor companies together to enable datacenter time-sensitive applications.</p>","code":"EW14","slug":"ew-time-appliances-project-tap","session_count":20,"alternate_count":5,"lightning_count":0,"lightning_alternate_count":0,"voting_visible":false,"chair_visible":true,"summit_id":31,"color":"#df796d","icon_url":null,"track_groups":[31,32],"allowed_tags":[60],"extra_questions":[],"selection_lists":[234,235,259,308,360,375,396,412,458,464,517],"allowed_access_levels":[{"id":96,"created":1627866697,"last_edited":1627866697,"name":"VIRTUAL-ALL","description":"Allows access to all areas of the virtual event","template_content":"","is_default":false,"summit_id":31}]},"location":{"id":219,"created":1613067195,"last_edited":1613067195,"name":"210AE","short_name":"","description":"<p>Executive Talks &amp; Engineering Workshops</p>","location_type":"Internal","order":11,"class_name":"SummitVenueRoom","capacity":300,"override_blackouts":false,"venue":{"id":209,"created":1613066436,"last_edited":1613066436,"name":"SJCC","short_name":"San Jose McEnery Convention Center","description":"<p>The San Jose McEnery Convention Center sits in the center of Downtown and boasts hundreds of varied events a year.

Advanced packaging is used to achieve higher integration densities and performance. However, managing  package thermal density is becoming challenging for accelerators and ASIC. In order to understand the thermal density trade off for die disaggregation advanced package solutions (2D, 2.5D, 3D), this paper selects a ASIC die with compute and SRAM as an example. This talk will focus on understanding the change in thermal density of a package from monolithic die to advanced packaging with chiplet die with 2D, 2.5D, and 3D package options and partner with ecosystem to understand the thermal solution (lid vs. lidless). The thermal performance among the different package options as well as the thermal risks and solutions are discussed in this paper.</p>","social_description":"","start_date":1636567200,"end_date":1636568100,"summit_id":31,"class_name":"Presentation","allow_feedback":false,"avg_feedback_rate":0,"is_published":true,"head_count":0,"rsvp_link":null,"rsvp_template_id":0,"rsvp_max_user_number":0,"rsvp_max_user_wait_list_number":0,"rsvp_regular_count":0,"rsvp_wait_count":0,"rsvp_external":false,"meeting_url":"","attendance_count":1,"current_attendance_count":0,"image":null,"stream_thumbnail":"https://image.mux.com/BqZB9rV02k6ESXzEJgDqgJUACgvDfjZ6L02TW1TKWCSQ00/thumbnail.jpg","level":"Advanced","created_by_id":28009,"updated_by_id":27695,"show_sponsors":false,"creator_id":28009,"moderator_speaker_id":0,"selection_plan_id":18,"problem_addressed":null,"attendees_expected_learnt":"<p>Thermal package model development</p>\n<p>Thermal performance comparison among different package technologies</p>\n<p>Thermal solution comparison including vapor chamber lid, traditional lid, and lid-less design</p>\n<p><br /></p>","to_record":true,"attending_media":false,"status":"Accepted","progress":"COMPLETE","selection_status":"accepted","disclaimer_accepted_date":1627080600,"disclaimer_accepted":true,"rank":33,"sponsors":[{"id":5,"created":1594672447,"last_edited":1594672447,"name":"Meta","url":"","display_on_site":false,"featured":false,"city":"","state":"","country":"","description":"","industry":"","contributions":"","contact_email":"","member_level":"None","admin_email":"","overview":"","products":"","commitment":"","commitment_author":"","logo":"https://object-storage.public.mtl1.vexxhost.net/swift/v1/6e4619c416ff4bd19e1c087f27a43eea/assets-fn/companies/5/logos/OCP21GLO-SessionBrandingBar-Sponsor-Meta1.png","big_logo":"https://object-storage.public.mtl1.vexxhost.net/swift/v1/6e4619c416ff4bd19e1c087f27a43eea/assets-fn/companies/5/logos/OCP21GLO-SessionBrandingBar-Sponsor-Meta.png","color":"#f0f0ee","sponsorships":[1311,1307,1312,1310,1313,1721,1735,1736,1741,1772,1775,1776,1779,1782,1785,1786,1789,1791,1796,1829,1835,1839,1841,1847,1860,1864,1866,1870,1871,1873,1880,1901,1908,1913,1914,1921,1923,1931,1954,1962,1964,1992,2085,2093,2118,1956,2096,1665,1865],"project_sponsorships":[]}],"tags":[],"feedback":[],"current_attendance":[],"type":{"id":371,"created":1613066057,"last_edited":1613066057,"name":"Presentation","class_name":"PresentationType","color":"#f0f0ee","black_out_times":false,"use_sponsors":true,"are_sponsors_mandatory":false,"allows_attachment":false,"allows_level":true,"is_default":true,"summit_id":31,"max_speakers":3,"min_speakers":1,"max_moderators":1,"min_moderators":0,"use_speakers":true,"are_speakers_mandatory":true,"use_moderator":true,"is_moderator_mandatory":false,"moderator_label":"","should_be_available_on_cfp":true,"summit_documents":[20],"allowed_media_upload_types":[18,31]},"track":{"id":35987,"created":1618866603,"last_edited":1618866603,"name":"EW: Server","description":"<p>Technologies and products for compute and hardware acceleration including but not limited to silicon, modularity, products and integration solutions.</p>\n<p>Includes Sub-Projects: OAI (Open Accelerator Infrastructure), ODSA (Open Domain-Specific Architecture), NIC/Mezz, HPC (High Performance Computing)</p>","code":"EW2","slug":"ew-server","session_count":41,"alternate_count":5,"lightning_count":0,"lightning_alternate_count":0,"voting_visible":true,"chair_visible":true,"summit_id":31,"color":"#ffeac2","icon_url":null,"track_groups":[31,32],"allowed_tags":[60],"extra_questions":[],"selection_lists":[214,215,249,272,273,279,287,288,297,307,328,351,367,386,402,440,452,465,471,511,512],"allowed_access_levels":[{"id":96,"created":1627866697,"last_edited":1627866697,"name":"VIRTUAL-ALL","description":"Allows access to all areas of the virtual event","template_content":"","is_default":false,"summit_id":31}]},"location":{"id":223,"created":1613067295,"last_edited":1613067295,"name":"211A-D","short_name":"","description":"<p>Engineering Workshops</p>","location_type":"Internal","order":15,"class_name":"SummitVenueRoom","capacity":300,"override_blackouts":false,"venue":{"id":209,"created":1613066436,"last_edited":1613066436,"name":"SJCC","short_name":"San Jose McEnery Convention Center","description":"<p>The San Jose McEnery Convention Center sits in the center of Downtown and boasts hundreds of varied events a year.

Select the right encryption technology to protect against most security attacks, while still ensure network performance, is of utmost importance. Media access control security (MACsec) has become an important encryption technology that is now shipped with next-generation chips, routers, and switches, including  OCP whitebox switch. It brings line-rate encryption throughput for high-speed Ethernet — critical for cloud and data center operation. This presentation will discuss the key use cases and the state of the industry, the challenges of securing high-speed Ethernet networks, the advantages of MACsec technology, and why test must evolve to ensure smooth deployment.</p>","social_description":"MACsec enables Cloud and Data center to secure data-in-motion without performance penalty","start_date":1636568700,"end_date":1636570200,"summit_id":31,"class_name":"Presentation","allow_feedback":false,"avg_feedback_rate":0,"is_published":true,"head_count":0,"rsvp_link":null,"rsvp_template_id":0,"rsvp_max_user_number":0,"rsvp_max_user_wait_list_number":0,"rsvp_regular_count":0,"rsvp_wait_count":0,"rsvp_external":false,"meeting_url":"","attendance_count":5,"current_attendance_count":0,"image":null,"stream_thumbnail":"https://image.mux.com/Jv7ocDS2ZZKA47yaNUZpk3WPZG00yzIyZSOtcN8SCzWo/thumbnail.jpg","level":"Intermediate","created_by_id":30183,"updated_by_id":27695,"show_sponsors":false,"creator_id":30183,"moderator_speaker_id":0,"selection_plan_id":18,"problem_addressed":null,"attendees_expected_learnt":"<p><br /></p>\n<p>· Why an older technology like MACsec is now mission-critical? </p>\n<p>· The state of the industry and the key use cases for hyperscalers</p>\n<p>· Why testing must evolve to ensure smooth deployment? </p>","to_record":true,"attending_media":true,"status":"Accepted","progress":"COMPLETE","selection_status":"accepted","disclaimer_accepted_date":1626910868,"disclaimer_accepted":true,"rank":5,"sponsors":[{"id":66,"created":1629874554,"last_edited":1629874554,"name":"Keysight Technologies","url":"","display_on_site":false,"featured":false,"city":"","state":"","country":"","description":"","industry":"","contributions":"","contact_email":"","member_level":"None","admin_email":"","overview":"","products":"","commitment":"","commitment_author":"","logo":"https://object-storage.public.mtl1.vexxhost.net/swift/v1/6e4619c416ff4bd19e1c087f27a43eea/assets-fn/companies/66/logos/OCP21GLO-SessionBrandingBar-Sponsor-Keysight.png","big_logo":null,"color":"#DADADA","sponsorships":[2324,1737,1809],"project_sponsorships":[]}],"tags":[],"feedback":[],"current_attendance":[],"type":{"id":371,"created":1613066057,"last_edited":1613066057,"name":"Presentation","class_name":"PresentationType","color":"#f0f0ee","black_out_times":false,"use_sponsors":true,"are_sponsors_mandatory":false,"allows_attachment":false,"allows_level":true,"is_default":true,"summit_id":31,"max_speakers":3,"min_speakers":1,"max_moderators":1,"min_moderators":0,"use_speakers":true,"are_speakers_mandatory":true,"use_moderator":true,"is_moderator_mandatory":false,"moderator_label":"","should_be_available_on_cfp":true,"summit_documents":[20],"allowed_media_upload_types":[18,31]},"track":{"id":35999,"created":1618866603,"last_edited":1618866603,"name":"EW: Security","description":"<p>The goal is to improve security across data centers through open standards.

NICs are also a key enabler for Cloud and Edge computing and we are just getting started.  Hyperscalers would like to see more innovation in this space and have a vibrant community of established and upstart vendors to choose from.  A key inhibitor to innovation is the lack of clarity on requirements from hyperscale environments.  We propose to create a new track in OCP to standardize on a core set of NIC requirements for hyperscale deployments. These requirements include offloads such as stateless network offloads, inline crypto, network virtualization, RDMA and transports with programmable congestion control. In this talk, we will discuss some of the challenges faced by hyperscalers, and propose tracks for standardization. </p>","social_description":"","start_date":1636568700,"end_date":1636570200,"summit_id":31,"class_name":"Presentation","allow_feedback":false,"avg_feedback_rate":0,"is_published":true,"head_count":0,"rsvp_link":null,"rsvp_template_id":0,"rsvp_max_user_number":0,"rsvp_max_user_wait_list_number":0,"rsvp_regular_count":0,"rsvp_wait_count":0,"rsvp_external":false,"meeting_url":"","attendance_count":0,"current_attendance_count":0,"image":null,"stream_thumbnail":"https://image.mux.com/yw6VdQECicpi9tQkgLQ73yvDRkD2Axa005qk5DztshLc/thumbnail.jpg","level":"Intermediate","created_by_id":31008,"updated_by_id":27695,"show_sponsors":false,"creator_id":31008,"moderator_speaker_id":0,"selection_plan_id":18,"problem_addressed":null,"attendees_expected_learnt":"<p> </p>","to_record":true,"attending_media":true,"status":"Accepted","progress":"COMPLETE","selection_status":"accepted","disclaimer_accepted_date":1627362345,"disclaimer_accepted":true,"rank":22,"sponsors":[],"tags":[],"feedback":[],"current_attendance":[],"type":{"id":371,"created":1613066057,"last_edited":1613066057,"name":"Presentation","class_name":"PresentationType","color":"#f0f0ee","black_out_times":false,"use_sponsors":true,"are_sponsors_mandatory":false,"allows_attachment":false,"allows_level":true,"is_default":true,"summit_id":31,"max_speakers":3,"min_speakers":1,"max_moderators":1,"min_moderators":0,"use_speakers":true,"are_speakers_mandatory":true,"use_moderator":true,"is_moderator_mandatory":false,"moderator_label":"","should_be_available_on_cfp":true,"summit_documents":[20],"allowed_media_upload_types":[18,31]},"track":{"id":35993,"created":1618866603,"last_edited":1618866603,"name":"EW: Networking","description":"<p>Networking hardware and software deployed into data centers, telecom central offices and enterprise.</p>\n<p>Includes Sub-Projects: Enterprise Connectivity Solutions (ECS), Open Network Linux (ONL), Open Network Install Environment (ONIE), SONiC</p>","code":"EW9","slug":"ew-networking","session_count":24,"alternate_count":5,"lightning_count":0,"lightning_alternate_count":0,"voting_visible":false,"chair_visible":true,"summit_id":31,"color":"#b2f8f8","icon_url":null,"track_groups":[31,32],"allowed_tags":[60],"extra_questions":[],"selection_lists":[224,225,254,265,280,281,295,298,356,371,391,407,443,450,456,466,515,523],"allowed_access_levels":[{"id":96,"created":1627866697,"last_edited":1627866697,"name":"VIRTUAL-ALL","description":"Allows access to all areas of the virtual event","template_content":"","is_default":false,"summit_id":31}]},"location":{"id":234,"created":1613067923,"last_edited":1613067923,"name":"LL20A","short_name":"","description":"<p>Symposium &amp; Engineering Workshop</p>","location_type":"Internal","order":26,"class_name":"SummitVenueRoom","capacity":200,"override_blackouts":false,"venue":{"id":209,"created":1613066436,"last_edited":1613066436,"name":"SJCC","short_name":"San Jose McEnery Convention Center","description":"<p>The San Jose McEnery Convention Center sits in the center of Downtown and boasts hundreds of varied events a year.

As digital-originated sales continued to increase, it is critical for large retailers to differentiate themselves with a unified experience across their mobile app, drive-up services, in-store services, and loyalty programs. This session walks attendees through how the Arrcus Connected Edge (ACE) platform allows large enterprise retailers to deploy an extensible fabric from data centers to warehouses to stores and other edge locations without compromising on scale and performance. The ACE platform eliminates the bottlenecks posed by legacy networking vendors’ limited offerings and provides enterprise retailers with a programmable and agile edge platform with a highly reliable unified technology stack, allowing to deliver new experiences for customers as business requirements and opportunities evolve.</p>","social_description":"","start_date":1636570800,"end_date":1636571700,"summit_id":31,"class_name":"Presentation","allow_feedback":false,"avg_feedback_rate":0,"is_published":true,"head_count":0,"rsvp_link":null,"rsvp_template_id":0,"rsvp_max_user_number":0,"rsvp_max_user_wait_list_number":0,"rsvp_regular_count":0,"rsvp_wait_count":0,"rsvp_external":false,"meeting_url":"","attendance_count":0,"current_attendance_count":0,"image":null,"stream_thumbnail":"https://image.mux.com/kHyRzW4vxmft85nae01rldy00Fchh01GYPk02y5LnPF300CQ/thumbnail.jpg","level":null,"created_by_id":27748,"updated_by_id":27695,"show_sponsors":true,"creator_id":27748,"moderator_speaker_id":0,"selection_plan_id":0,"problem_addressed":null,"attendees_expected_learnt":"","to_record":true,"attending_media":false,"status":"Accepted","progress":"COMPLETE","selection_status":"unaccepted","disclaimer_accepted_date":null,"disclaimer_accepted":false,"rank":0,"sponsors":[{"id":57,"created":1629874166,"last_edited":1629874166,"name":"Arrcus","url":"","display_on_site":false,"featured":false,"city":"","state":"","country":"","description":"","industry":"","contributions":"","contact_email":"","member_level":"None","admin_email":"","overview":"","products":"","commitment":"","commitment_author":"","logo":"https://object-storage.public.mtl1.vexxhost.net/swift/v1/6e4619c416ff4bd19e1c087f27a43eea/assets-fn/companies/57/logos/OCP21GLO-SessionBrandingBar-Sponsor-Arrcus1.png","big_logo":"https://object-storage.public.mtl1.vexxhost.net/swift/v1/6e4619c416ff4bd19e1c087f27a43eea/assets-fn/companies/57/logos/OCP21GLO-SessionBrandingBar-Sponsor-Arrcus.png","color":"#DADADA","sponsorships":[2331,2121],"project_sponsorships":[]}],"tags":[],"feedback":[],"current_attendance":[],"type":{"id":417,"created":1628269224,"last_edited":1628269224,"name":"Sponsor Presentation","class_name":"PresentationType","color":"#f0f0ee","black_out_times":false,"use_sponsors":true,"are_sponsors_mandatory":false,"allows_attachment":false,"allows_level":false,"is_default":false,"summit_id":31,"max_speakers":0,"min_speakers":0,"max_moderators":0,"min_moderators":0,"use_speakers":true,"are_speakers_mandatory":false,"use_moderator":false,"is_moderator_mandatory":false,"moderator_label":"","should_be_available_on_cfp":false,"summit_documents":[],"allowed_media_upload_types":[18,31]},"track":{"id":36011,"created":1627756590,"last_edited":1627756590,"name":"Expo Hall Talk","description":"<p>Expo Hall Talks presented by Sponsors</p>","code":"EHT","slug":"expo-hall-talk","session_count":100,"alternate_count":0,"lightning_count":0,"lightning_alternate_count":0,"voting_visible":false,"chair_visible":false,"summit_id":31,"color":"#ff9c00","icon_url":null,"track_groups":[32],"allowed_tags":[60],"extra_questions":[],"selection_lists":[],"allowed_access_levels":[]},"location":{"id":216,"created":1613066981,"last_edited":1613066981,"name":"Hall 1","short_name":null,"description":"<p>Expo&nbsp;</p>","location_type":"Internal","order":8,"class_name":"SummitVenueRoom","capacity":1000,"override_blackouts":true,"venue":{"id":209,"created":1613066436,"last_edited":1613066436,"name":"SJCC","short_name":"San Jose McEnery Convention Center","description":"<p>The San Jose McEnery Convention Center sits in the center of Downtown and boasts hundreds of varied events a year.

The system is based on bi-directional power delivery, low power backplane to battery charging or high power battery discharge to backplane, with the latter requiring a rapid response time. Many of the challenges are hidden inside the trial and error process of burned components, slower than expected response times, extreme power handling requirements, and logic confusion, all aimed at seamless system backup. Getting through the details of the hardware and software design requires simulation, testing, evaluation, and verification, mixed with a few sleepless nights. This is a case study taking you through simple power conversion examples delivering 3kW in 5+1 redundancy to the system backplane, including the interactions and communications. We will highlight simulation and bench work with scope shots and simplified diagrams on how the system delivers 15kW for 300 seconds.</p>","social_description":"ORV3 BBU Bi-directional power storage/backup for the next generation OCP Rack System.","start_date":1636570800,"end_date":1636572000,"summit_id":31,"class_name":"Presentation","allow_feedback":false,"avg_feedback_rate":0,"is_published":true,"head_count":0,"rsvp_link":null,"rsvp_template_id":0,"rsvp_max_user_number":0,"rsvp_max_user_wait_list_number":0,"rsvp_regular_count":0,"rsvp_wait_count":0,"rsvp_external":false,"meeting_url":"","attendance_count":1,"current_attendance_count":0,"image":null,"stream_thumbnail":"https://image.mux.com/jZ017SXzSl00F02rf3mqSu2pSm02l7pt6IlGfARjm4VpjRk/thumbnail.jpg","level":"Advanced","created_by_id":29907,"updated_by_id":27695,"show_sponsors":false,"creator_id":29907,"moderator_speaker_id":0,"selection_plan_id":18,"problem_addressed":null,"attendees_expected_learnt":"<ul>\n  <li>Li-Ion Battery management details</li>\n  <li>Bi-directional power conversion\n    <ul>\n      <li>Single phase buck battery charging</li>\n      <li>Multi-phase boost discharge</li>\n      <li>Rapid transition between modes</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>Accurate current share techniques\n    <ul>\n      <li>Analog current share bus</li>\n      <li>Analog voltage droop  </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>Precision Voltage and Current control</li>\n  <li>System monitoring/communications and operational mode requirements</li>\n  <li>Reliability </li>\n  <li>Interoperability</li>\n  <li>Safety</li>\n</ul>","to_record":true,"attending_media":true,"status":"Accepted","progress":"COMPLETE","selection_status":"unaccepted","disclaimer_accepted_date":1626830595,"disclaimer_accepted":true,"rank":0,"sponsors":[],"tags":[{"id":60,"created":1634321379,"last_edited":1634321379,"tag":"vod"}],"feedback":[],"current_attendance":[],"type":{"id":371,"created":1613066057,"last_edited":1613066057,"name":"Presentation","class_name":"PresentationType","color":"#f0f0ee","black_out_times":false,"use_sponsors":true,"are_sponsors_mandatory":false,"allows_attachment":false,"allows_level":true,"is_default":true,"summit_id":31,"max_speakers":3,"min_speakers":1,"max_moderators":1,"min_moderators":0,"use_speakers":true,"are_speakers_mandatory":true,"use_moderator":true,"is_moderator_mandatory":false,"moderator_label":"","should_be_available_on_cfp":true,"summit_documents":[20],"allowed_media_upload_types":[18,31]},"track":{"id":35986,"created":1618866603,"last_edited":1618866603,"name":"EW: Rack & Power","description":"<p>Conversion, distribution and resiliency of AC and DC power.

DPU is a fully integrated data-center-on-a-chip platform that can manage the data center operating system instead of the host processor, enabling security and orchestration of the supercomputer, and dense computing infrastructure with its OCP form factor.

This means that the number of clients (ordinary clocks) need to scale up rapidly if you move down the clock tree. Traditionally, scaling up the number of clients is done via boundary clocks. However, the integration of boundary clocks in existing switches is more involved and requires major changes in the packet flow. Alternatively, transparent clocks can offer the scale up, with the main difference that they can only provide extension of compliant physical connections and not any scaling in client packet synchronization. In this presentation, we will compare BC based and TC based deployment scenarios for data centers and present test results for both. We will discuss performance and scalability aspects for both scenarios and present test results for the scenarios discussed.</p>","social_description":"Practical Network Solutions in PTP HyperScale Data Centers","start_date":1636570800,"end_date":1636572300,"summit_id":31,"class_name":"Presentation","allow_feedback":false,"avg_feedback_rate":0,"is_published":true,"head_count":0,"rsvp_link":null,"rsvp_template_id":0,"rsvp_max_user_number":0,"rsvp_max_user_wait_list_number":0,"rsvp_regular_count":0,"rsvp_wait_count":0,"rsvp_external":false,"meeting_url":"","attendance_count":0,"current_attendance_count":0,"image":null,"stream_thumbnail":"https://image.mux.com/eBzMKVBZfmveJ4ZOsnv2vAfVUHA1VOAkNIUIqkH9sWA/thumbnail.jpg","level":"Advanced","created_by_id":28156,"updated_by_id":27695,"show_sponsors":false,"creator_id":28156,"moderator_speaker_id":0,"selection_plan_id":18,"problem_addressed":null,"attendees_expected_learnt":"<p>The challenges of hyper-scale number of  clients on clock trees </p>\n<p>Compare BC based and TC based deployment scenarios for data centers </p>","to_record":true,"attending_media":true,"status":"Accepted","progress":"COMPLETE","selection_status":"accepted","disclaimer_accepted_date":1627018878,"disclaimer_accepted":true,"rank":7,"sponsors":[{"id":5,"created":1594672447,"last_edited":1594672447,"name":"Meta","url":"","display_on_site":false,"featured":false,"city":"","state":"","country":"","description":"","industry":"","contributions":"","contact_email":"","member_level":"None","admin_email":"","overview":"","products":"","commitment":"","commitment_author":"","logo":"https://object-storage.public.mtl1.vexxhost.net/swift/v1/6e4619c416ff4bd19e1c087f27a43eea/assets-fn/companies/5/logos/OCP21GLO-SessionBrandingBar-Sponsor-Meta1.png","big_logo":"https://object-storage.public.mtl1.vexxhost.net/swift/v1/6e4619c416ff4bd19e1c087f27a43eea/assets-fn/companies/5/logos/OCP21GLO-SessionBrandingBar-Sponsor-Meta.png","color":"#f0f0ee","sponsorships":[1311,1307,1312,1310,1313,1721,1735,1736,1741,1772,1775,1776,1779,1782,1785,1786,1789,1791,1796,1829,1835,1839,1841,1847,1860,1864,1866,1870,1871,1873,1880,1901,1908,1913,1914,1921,1923,1931,1954,1962,1964,1992,2085,2093,2118,1956,2096,1665,1865],"project_sponsorships":[]}],"tags":[],"feedback":[],"current_attendance":[],"type":{"id":371,"created":1613066057,"last_edited":1613066057,"name":"Presentation","class_name":"PresentationType","color":"#f0f0ee","black_out_times":false,"use_sponsors":true,"are_sponsors_mandatory":false,"allows_attachment":false,"allows_level":true,"is_default":true,"summit_id":31,"max_speakers":3,"min_speakers":1,"max_moderators":1,"min_moderators":0,"use_speakers":true,"are_speakers_mandatory":true,"use_moderator":true,"is_moderator_mandatory":false,"moderator_label":"","should_be_available_on_cfp":true,"summit_documents":[20],"allowed_media_upload_types":[18,31]},"track":{"id":35998,"created":1618866603,"last_edited":1618866603,"name":"EW: Time Appliances Project (TAP)","description":"<p>Aims to bring together the community of datacenter operators, application developers, and equipment and semiconductor companies together to enable datacenter time-sensitive applications.</p>","code":"EW14","slug":"ew-time-appliances-project-tap","session_count":20,"alternate_count":5,"lightning_count":0,"lightning_alternate_count":0,"voting_visible":false,"chair_visible":true,"summit_id":31,"color":"#df796d","icon_url":null,"track_groups":[31,32],"allowed_tags":[60],"extra_questions":[],"selection_lists":[234,235,259,308,360,375,396,412,458,464,517],"allowed_access_levels":[{"id":96,"created":1627866697,"last_edited":1627866697,"name":"VIRTUAL-ALL","description":"Allows access to all areas of the virtual event","template_content":"","is_default":false,"summit_id":31}]},"location":{"id":219,"created":1613067195,"last_edited":1613067195,"name":"210AE","short_name":"","description":"<p>Executive Talks &amp; Engineering Workshops</p>","location_type":"Internal","order":11,"class_name":"SummitVenueRoom","capacity":300,"override_blackouts":false,"venue":{"id":209,"created":1613066436,"last_edited":1613066436,"name":"SJCC","short_name":"San Jose McEnery Convention Center","description":"<p>The San Jose McEnery Convention Center sits in the center of Downtown and boasts hundreds of varied events a year.

There are so many factors to consider and it is sometimes not obvious when and why it makes sense to implement chiplets. A common model for analyzing the cost benefit/trade offs of chiplets can help accelerate that decision making process. Phase 1 of such a model has been developed, which takes into account more than 20+ factors that are pertinent to the trade offs. Additional parameters will also be added in subsequent phases. This is a joint collaboration with Google, ARM and Microchip under the ODSA-Business Workgroup umbrella, with broad inputs from packaging, test equipment and other vendors. The model will be used to show the impact of various parameters on the tradeoffs, which in turn can help practitioners in rapidly iterating to a chiplet solution that is economically and technically viable.</p>","social_description":"","start_date":1636572000,"end_date":1636573200,"summit_id":31,"class_name":"Presentation","allow_feedback":false,"avg_feedback_rate":0,"is_published":true,"head_count":0,"rsvp_link":null,"rsvp_template_id":0,"rsvp_max_user_number":0,"rsvp_max_user_wait_list_number":0,"rsvp_regular_count":0,"rsvp_wait_count":0,"rsvp_external":false,"meeting_url":"","attendance_count":1,"current_attendance_count":0,"image":null,"stream_thumbnail":"https://image.mux.com/BqZB9rV02k6ESXzEJgDqgJUACgvDfjZ6L02TW1TKWCSQ00/thumbnail.jpg","level":"Intermediate","created_by_id":31008,"updated_by_id":27695,"show_sponsors":false,"creator_id":31008,"moderator_speaker_id":0,"selection_plan_id":18,"problem_addressed":null,"attendees_expected_learnt":"<p> </p>","to_record":true,"attending_media":true,"status":"Accepted","progress":"COMPLETE","selection_status":"accepted","disclaimer_accepted_date":1627058037,"disclaimer_accepted":true,"rank":25,"sponsors":[{"id":64,"created":1629874517,"last_edited":1629874517,"name":"Arm","url":"","display_on_site":false,"featured":false,"city":"","state":"","country":"","description":"","industry":"","contributions":"","contact_email":"","member_level":"None","admin_email":"","overview":"","products":"","commitment":"","commitment_author":"","logo":"https://object-storage.public.mtl1.vexxhost.net/swift/v1/6e4619c416ff4bd19e1c087f27a43eea/assets-fn/companies/64/logos/OCP21GLO-SessionBrandingBar-Sponsor-arm.png","big_logo":null,"color":"#DADADA","sponsorships":[2327,1760,1859,1897,2091],"project_sponsorships":[]}],"tags":[],"feedback":[],"current_attendance":[],"type":{"id":371,"created":1613066057,"last_edited":1613066057,"name":"Presentation","class_name":"PresentationType","color":"#f0f0ee","black_out_times":false,"use_sponsors":true,"are_sponsors_mandatory":false,"allows_attachment":false,"allows_level":true,"is_default":true,"summit_id":31,"max_speakers":3,"min_speakers":1,"max_moderators":1,"min_moderators":0,"use_speakers":true,"are_speakers_mandatory":true,"use_moderator":true,"is_moderator_mandatory":false,"moderator_label":"","should_be_available_on_cfp":true,"summit_documents":[20],"allowed_media_upload_types":[18,31]},"track":{"id":35987,"created":1618866603,"last_edited":1618866603,"name":"EW: Server","description":"<p>Technologies and products for compute and hardware acceleration including but not limited to silicon, modularity, products and integration solutions.</p>\n<p>Includes Sub-Projects: OAI (Open Accelerator Infrastructure), ODSA (Open Domain-Specific Architecture), NIC/Mezz, HPC (High Performance Computing)</p>","code":"EW2","slug":"ew-server","session_count":41,"alternate_count":5,"lightning_count":0,"lightning_alternate_count":0,"voting_visible":true,"chair_visible":true,"summit_id":31,"color":"#ffeac2","icon_url":null,"track_groups":[31,32],"allowed_tags":[60],"extra_questions":[],"selection_lists":[214,215,249,272,273,279,287,288,297,307,328,351,367,386,402,440,452,465,471,511,512],"allowed_access_levels":[{"id":96,"created":1627866697,"last_edited":1627866697,"name":"VIRTUAL-ALL","description":"Allows access to all areas of the virtual event","template_content":"","is_default":false,"summit_id":31}]},"location":{"id":223,"created":1613067295,"last_edited":1613067295,"name":"211A-D","short_name":"","description":"<p>Engineering Workshops</p>","location_type":"Internal","order":15,"class_name":"SummitVenueRoom","capacity":300,"override_blackouts":false,"venue":{"id":209,"created":1613066436,"last_edited":1613066436,"name":"SJCC","short_name":"San Jose McEnery Convention Center","description":"<p>The San Jose McEnery Convention Center sits in the center of Downtown and boasts hundreds of varied events a year.

Open interfaces and smart feature extraction of the network behavior will enable and boost the usage of AI/ML for networking in disaggregated solutions. This will facilitate the mix & match of networking gear with AI/ML technologies from different entities. In this talk, I will first list several use cases of AI/ML for networking applications and tools to support this functionality such as data reduction techniques that provide flow signatures, with AI engines centralized or on the networking gear. Following, I will share our view on the role of OCP in AI for networking and proposed work that could be done in concert with the SAI WG. In the end, I will showcase a solution for high-rate anomaly detection based on a network providing smart statistics on a group of packets and on a neural network that creates an ensemble of autoencoders.</p>","social_description":"","start_date":1636572300,"end_date":1636573800,"summit_id":31,"class_name":"Presentation","allow_feedback":false,"avg_feedback_rate":0,"is_published":true,"head_count":0,"rsvp_link":null,"rsvp_template_id":0,"rsvp_max_user_number":0,"rsvp_max_user_wait_list_number":0,"rsvp_regular_count":0,"rsvp_wait_count":0,"rsvp_external":false,"meeting_url":"","attendance_count":0,"current_attendance_count":0,"image":null,"stream_thumbnail":"https://image.mux.com/yw6VdQECicpi9tQkgLQ73yvDRkD2Axa005qk5DztshLc/thumbnail.jpg","level":"Intermediate","created_by_id":29786,"updated_by_id":27695,"show_sponsors":false,"creator_id":29786,"moderator_speaker_id":0,"selection_plan_id":18,"problem_addressed":null,"attendees_expected_learnt":"<p> Attendees can expect to learn:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The use cases of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) for networking including application classification of encrypted traffic flows, detection of anomalies in traffic patterns indicating security risks and network faults.</li>\n  <li>Data reduction techniques to create flow fingerprinting.</li>\n  <li>Telemetry enhancements to the Switch Abstraction Interface (SAI) that are needed to create an open disaggregated solution between networking devices and AI engines.</li>\n  <li>The results of a study that demonstrates how the above principles can achieve a ML solution that analyzes reduced features extracted from a high rate stream of network packets and identifies network anomalies.</li>\n</ul>","to_record":true,"attending_media":true,"status":"Accepted","progress":"COMPLETE","selection_status":"accepted","disclaimer_accepted_date":1627026919,"disclaimer_accepted":true,"rank":17,"sponsors":[],"tags":[],"feedback":[],"current_attendance":[],"type":{"id":371,"created":1613066057,"last_edited":1613066057,"name":"Presentation","class_name":"PresentationType","color":"#f0f0ee","black_out_times":false,"use_sponsors":true,"are_sponsors_mandatory":false,"allows_attachment":false,"allows_level":true,"is_default":true,"summit_id":31,"max_speakers":3,"min_speakers":1,"max_moderators":1,"min_moderators":0,"use_speakers":true,"are_speakers_mandatory":true,"use_moderator":true,"is_moderator_mandatory":false,"moderator_label":"","should_be_available_on_cfp":true,"summit_documents":[20],"allowed_media_upload_types":[18,31]},"track":{"id":35993,"created":1618866603,"last_edited":1618866603,"name":"EW: Networking","description":"<p>Networking hardware and software deployed into data centers, telecom central offices and enterprise.</p>\n<p>Includes Sub-Projects: Enterprise Connectivity Solutions (ECS), Open Network Linux (ONL), Open Network Install Environment (ONIE), SONiC</p>","code":"EW9","slug":"ew-networking","session_count":24,"alternate_count":5,"lightning_count":0,"lightning_alternate_count":0,"voting_visible":false,"chair_visible":true,"summit_id":31,"color":"#b2f8f8","icon_url":null,"track_groups":[31,32],"allowed_tags":[60],"extra_questions":[],"selection_lists":[224,225,254,265,280,281,295,298,356,371,391,407,443,450,456,466,515,523],"allowed_access_levels":[{"id":96,"created":1627866697,"last_edited":1627866697,"name":"VIRTUAL-ALL","description":"Allows access to all areas of the virtual event","template_content":"","is_default":false,"summit_id":31}]},"location":{"id":234,"created":1613067923,"last_edited":1613067923,"name":"LL20A","short_name":"","description":"<p>Symposium &amp; Engineering Workshop</p>","location_type":"Internal","order":26,"class_name":"SummitVenueRoom","capacity":200,"override_blackouts":false,"venue":{"id":209,"created":1613066436,"last_edited":1613066436,"name":"SJCC","short_name":"San Jose McEnery Convention Center","description":"<p>The San Jose McEnery Convention Center sits in the center of Downtown and boasts hundreds of varied events a year.

The PINS stack combines the benefits of the SDN controller with SONiC and brings optionality to SDN networking. P4Runtime for SONiC is opt-in, has standard interfaces, enables rapid innovation, provides automated validation and serves as unambiguous documentation of the switch pipeline. A canonical family of P4 programs (included in the repository) documents the packet forwarding pipeline of SAI. Remote SDN controllers will use these P4 programs to control the switch forwarding behavior over the P4RT API. This presentation will cover the architecture, the high level design and the various supplementary features the team has implemented as part of the stack. We will also discuss in detail some of the use cases that are enabled by the PINS stack.</p>","social_description":"PINS brings the benefits of SDN to SONiC..

Hall Talk - Spotlight: Data Center Sustainability - Presented by Vertiv","description":"<p>Conversations around efficiency and utilization in data centers are evolving to reflect a more comprehensive, aggressive focus on sustainability. This movement recognizes the urgency of the climate crisis, the relationship between resource availability and rising costs, and shifting politics around the world. The world's largest data center operators are establishing bold sustainability goals and turning to equipment providers, including Vertiv, to make them a reality. It's not about buying renewable energy to offset grid draws; these are difference-making targets focused on transitioning completely to renewable energy and carbon-free or -negative operations, in some cases as early as 2025. </p>\n<p>We see a two-stage sustainability strategy emerging for data center operators. Stage 1: Match energy use with 100% renewable energy. Stage 2: operate 24/7 on carbon-free energy generated locally at the data center. This presentation looks at that strategy in detail and explains why traditional approaches to energy efficiency can't meet today's aggressive sustainability goals.</p>","social_description":"","start_date":1636573200,"end_date":1636574100,"summit_id":31,"class_name":"Presentation","allow_feedback":false,"avg_feedback_rate":0,"is_published":true,"head_count":0,"rsvp_link":null,"rsvp_template_id":0,"rsvp_max_user_number":0,"rsvp_max_user_wait_list_number":0,"rsvp_regular_count":0,"rsvp_wait_count":0,"rsvp_external":false,"meeting_url":"","attendance_count":0,"current_attendance_count":0,"image":null,"stream_thumbnail":"https://image.mux.com/kHyRzW4vxmft85nae01rldy00Fchh01GYPk02y5LnPF300CQ/thumbnail.jpg","level":null,"created_by_id":27748,"updated_by_id":27695,"show_sponsors":true,"creator_id":27748,"moderator_speaker_id":0,"selection_plan_id":0,"problem_addressed":null,"attendees_expected_learnt":"","to_record":true,"attending_media":false,"status":"Accepted","progress":"COMPLETE","selection_status":"unaccepted","disclaimer_accepted_date":null,"disclaimer_accepted":false,"rank":0,"sponsors":[{"id":55,"created":1629874113,"last_edited":1629874113,"name":"Vertiv","url":"","display_on_site":false,"featured":false,"city":"","state":"","country":"","description":"","industry":"","contributions":"","contact_email":"","member_level":"None","admin_email":"","overview":"","products":"","commitment":"","commitment_author":"","logo":"https://object-storage.public.mtl1.vexxhost.net/swift/v1/6e4619c416ff4bd19e1c087f27a43eea/assets-fn/companies/55/logos/OCP21GLO-SessionBrandingBar-Sponsor-Vertiv1.png","big_logo":"https://object-storage.public.mtl1.vexxhost.net/swift/v1/6e4619c416ff4bd19e1c087f27a43eea/assets-fn/companies/55/logos/OCP21GLO-SessionBrandingBar-Sponsor-Vertiv.png","color":"#DADADA","sponsorships":[2284,1958,2123,1717],"project_sponsorships":[]}],"tags":[],"feedback":[],"current_attendance":[],"type":{"id":417,"created":1628269224,"last_edited":1628269224,"name":"Sponsor Presentation","class_name":"PresentationType","color":"#f0f0ee","black_out_times":false,"use_sponsors":true,"are_sponsors_mandatory":false,"allows_attachment":false,"allows_level":false,"is_default":false,"summit_id":31,"max_speakers":0,"min_speakers":0,"max_moderators":0,"min_moderators":0,"use_speakers":true,"are_speakers_mandatory":false,"use_moderator":false,"is_moderator_mandatory":false,"moderator_label":"","should_be_available_on_cfp":false,"summit_documents":[],"allowed_media_upload_types":[18,31]},"track":{"id":36011,"created":1627756590,"last_edited":1627756590,"name":"Expo Hall Talk","description":"<p>Expo Hall Talks presented by Sponsors</p>","code":"EHT","slug":"expo-hall-talk","session_count":100,"alternate_count":0,"lightning_count":0,"lightning_alternate_count":0,"voting_visible":false,"chair_visible":false,"summit_id":31,"color":"#ff9c00","icon_url":null,"track_groups":[32],"allowed_tags":[60],"extra_questions":[],"selection_lists":[],"allowed_access_levels":[]},"location":{"id":216,"created":1613066981,"last_edited":1613066981,"name":"Hall 1","short_name":null,"description":"<p>Expo&nbsp;</p>","location_type":"Internal","order":8,"class_name":"SummitVenueRoom","capacity":1000,"override_blackouts":true,"venue":{"id":209,"created":1613066436,"last_edited":1613066436,"name":"SJCC","short_name":"San Jose McEnery Convention Center","description":"<p>The San Jose McEnery Convention Center sits in the center of Downtown and boasts hundreds of varied events a year.

This falling utility has led to the adoption of active interconnect (optics or AECs) in an increasing % of switch ports with DACs now primarily used for NIC-TOR applications. At 112G/lane, a new factor is added – a tax on the cost of the switch to support DACs via a CR compliant port – this tax increases the cost of that switch by 20%and increases the power per port by 100% driven by those power-hungry 112G/lane LR serdes. When combined with 800G cables that are as thick as a garden hose and can no longer be routed at a useful density you reach a clear conclusion – DACs drive an unacceptable tax into the switch which is no longer justified by their  alling utility. 112G/lane is the end of the road for DACs.    </p>","social_description":"","start_date":1636577400,"end_date":1636578300,"summit_id":31,"class_name":"Presentation","allow_feedback":false,"avg_feedback_rate":0,"is_published":true,"head_count":0,"rsvp_link":null,"rsvp_template_id":0,"rsvp_max_user_number":0,"rsvp_max_user_wait_list_number":0,"rsvp_regular_count":0,"rsvp_wait_count":0,"rsvp_external":false,"meeting_url":"","attendance_count":0,"current_attendance_count":0,"image":null,"stream_thumbnail":"https://image.mux.com/kHyRzW4vxmft85nae01rldy00Fchh01GYPk02y5LnPF300CQ/thumbnail.jpg","level":null,"created_by_id":27748,"updated_by_id":27695,"show_sponsors":true,"creator_id":27748,"moderator_speaker_id":0,"selection_plan_id":0,"problem_addressed":null,"attendees_expected_learnt":"","to_record":true,"attending_media":false,"status":"Accepted","progress":"COMPLETE","selection_status":"unaccepted","disclaimer_accepted_date":null,"disclaimer_accepted":false,"rank":0,"sponsors":[{"id":51,"created":1629874049,"last_edited":1629874049,"name":"Credo","url":"","display_on_site":false,"featured":false,"city":"","state":"","country":"","description":"","industry":"","contributions":"","contact_email":"","member_level":"None","admin_email":"","overview":"","products":"","commitment":"","commitment_author":"","logo":"https://object-storage.public.mtl1.vexxhost.net/swift/v1/6e4619c416ff4bd19e1c087f27a43eea/assets-fn/companies/51/logos/OCP21GLO-SessionBrandingBar-Sponsor-Credo1.png","big_logo":"https://object-storage.public.mtl1.vexxhost.net/swift/v1/6e4619c416ff4bd19e1c087f27a43eea/assets-fn/companies/51/logos/OCP21GLO-SessionBrandingBar-Sponsor-Credo.png","color":"#DADADA","sponsorships":[2340,2126],"project_sponsorships":[]}],"tags":[],"feedback":[],"current_attendance":[],"type":{"id":417,"created":1628269224,"last_edited":1628269224,"name":"Sponsor Presentation","class_name":"PresentationType","color":"#f0f0ee","black_out_times":false,"use_sponsors":true,"are_sponsors_mandatory":false,"allows_attachment":false,"allows_level":false,"is_default":false,"summit_id":31,"max_speakers":0,"min_speakers":0,"max_moderators":0,"min_moderators":0,"use_speakers":true,"are_speakers_mandatory":false,"use_moderator":false,"is_moderator_mandatory":false,"moderator_label":"","should_be_available_on_cfp":false,"summit_documents":[],"allowed_media_upload_types":[18,31]},"track":{"id":36011,"created":1627756590,"last_edited":1627756590,"name":"Expo Hall Talk","description":"<p>Expo Hall Talks presented by Sponsors</p>","code":"EHT","slug":"expo-hall-talk","session_count":100,"alternate_count":0,"lightning_count":0,"lightning_alternate_count":0,"voting_visible":false,"chair_visible":false,"summit_id":31,"color":"#ff9c00","icon_url":null,"track_groups":[32],"allowed_tags":[60],"extra_questions":[],"selection_lists":[],"allowed_access_levels":[]},"location":{"id":216,"created":1613066981,"last_edited":1613066981,"name":"Hall 1","short_name":null,"description":"<p>Expo&nbsp;</p>","location_type":"Internal","order":8,"class_name":"SummitVenueRoom","capacity":1000,"override_blackouts":true,"venue":{"id":209,"created":1613066436,"last_edited":1613066436,"name":"SJCC","short_name":"San Jose McEnery Convention Center","description":"<p>The San Jose McEnery Convention Center sits in the center of Downtown and boasts hundreds of varied events a year.

Acoustic Effects on HDD Performance","description":"<p>As Hard Disk Drive (HDD) areal density has grown, increasing the Tracks Per Inch (TPI), the ability of the HDD servo system to filter out external vibrations becomes increasingly more difficult.  The external vibrations can come from the traditionally known chassis operational vibrations, drive to drive interactions, buzzers, nearby equipment, and many other sources.  Acoustics transmitted from Air Moving Devices (AMDs) operating at high speeds, though, have become a much bigger factor in the performance of HDDs.  Testing was completed to evaluate the benefits of a blower compared to the usually used axial fan in a high density storage system.  The blower is sized to fit into the same slot as the axial fan.  The HDD

As we increase the rack airflow limits while maintaining existing data center(DC) designs, there is potential risk to thermal health and DC efficiency due to an undesirable thermal phenomena called hot air recirculation. Such trends call for re-evaluation of existing data center designs and its current design guidelines. DC systems thermal analysis is a connecting link to successfully integrate the high CFM and high power racks into data halls while ensuring overall thermal health of our IT. In this study, we identified constraints associated with system level airflow behavior that influence the rack deployment.

Over the past few years, the community has embraced Open accelerator infrastructure successfully around efforts such as OAM and UBB. AI Training as a solution requires significant interoperability at the cluster level to deliver the solution. Hence, having open and interoperable hardware of the key AI Training cluster ingredients with ecosystem support is both a natural and a necessary progression of the Open Accelerator Infrastructure efforts. This panel will feature participants from end users, accelerator, network, compute ingredient providers to name a few and discuss both contributions to Open accelerator infrastructure in the past and discuss how we further evolve this as a community towards open and interoperable ecosystem of AI Training Clusters in the future. </p>\n<p><br /></p>","social_description":"","start_date":1636581600,"end_date":1636584600,"summit_id":31,"class_name":"Presentation","allow_feedback":false,"avg_feedback_rate":0,"is_published":true,"head_count":0,"rsvp_link":null,"rsvp_template_id":0,"rsvp_max_user_number":0,"rsvp_max_user_wait_list_number":0,"rsvp_regular_count":0,"rsvp_wait_count":0,"rsvp_external":false,"meeting_url":"","attendance_count":0,"current_attendance_count":0,"image":null,"stream_thumbnail":"https://image.mux.com/BqZB9rV02k6ESXzEJgDqgJUACgvDfjZ6L02TW1TKWCSQ00/thumbnail.jpg","level":"Intermediate","created_by_id":31078,"updated_by_id":27695,"show_sponsors":false,"creator_id":31078,"moderator_speaker_id":27412,"selection_plan_id":18,"problem_addressed":null,"attendees_expected_learnt":"<p>Attendees will learn about current open accelerator infrastructure efforts at the module and board level and get insight into industry commitment to enabling this at the cluster level.  </p>","to_record":true,"attending_media":true,"status":"Accepted","progress":"COMPLETE","selection_status":"accepted","disclaimer_accepted_date":1626912002,"disclaimer_accepted":true,"rank":15,"sponsors":[],"tags":[],"feedback":[],"current_attendance":[],"type":{"id":373,"created":1613066057,"last_edited":1613066057,"name":"Panel","class_name":"PresentationType","color":"#f0f0ee","black_out_times":false,"use_sponsors":false,"are_sponsors_mandatory":false,"allows_attachment":false,"allows_level":true,"is_default":true,"summit_id":31,"max_speakers":5,"min_speakers":1,"max_moderators":1,"min_moderators":0,"use_speakers":true,"are_speakers_mandatory":true,"use_moderator":true,"is_moderator_mandatory":false,"moderator_label":"","should_be_available_on_cfp":true,"summit_documents":[20],"allowed_media_upload_types":[18,31]},"track":{"id":35987,"created":1618866603,"last_edited":1618866603,"name":"EW: Server","description":"<p>Technologies and products for compute and hardware acceleration including but not limited to silicon, modularity, products and integration solutions.</p>\n<p>Includes Sub-Projects: OAI (Open Accelerator Infrastructure), ODSA (Open Domain-Specific Architecture), NIC/Mezz, HPC (High Performance Computing)</p>","code":"EW2","slug":"ew-server","session_count":41,"alternate_count":5,"lightning_count":0,"lightning_alternate_count":0,"voting_visible":true,"chair_visible":true,"summit_id":31,"color":"#ffeac2","icon_url":null,"track_groups":[31,32],"allowed_tags":[60],"extra_questions":[],"selection_lists":[214,215,249,272,273,279,287,288,297,307,328,351,367,386,402,440,452,465,471,511,512],"allowed_access_levels":[{"id":96,"created":1627866697,"last_edited":1627866697,"name":"VIRTUAL-ALL","description":"Allows access to all areas of the virtual event","template_content":"","is_default":false,"summit_id":31}]},"location":{"id":223,"created":1613067295,"last_edited":1613067295,"name":"211A-D","short_name":"","description":"<p>Engineering Workshops</p>","location_type":"Internal","order":15,"class_name":"SummitVenueRoom","capacity":300,"override_blackouts":false,"venue":{"id":209,"created":1613066436,"last_edited":1613066436,"name":"SJCC","short_name":"San Jose McEnery Convention Center","description":"<p>The San Jose McEnery Convention Center sits in the center of Downtown and boasts hundreds of varied events a year.

This session will share lessons learned in conducting LCAs across a few different projects, share insights for others looking to conduct LCAs on cloud hardware and infrastructure and discuss challenges encountered in the process. We hope this session will contribute to OCP’s work to develop a framework around how to do LCAs across our industry to streamline the process and reports enabling cross company comparisons and efficiency across shared suppliers.  </p>","social_description":"Cloud LCA 101","start_date":1636583100,"end_date":1636584600,"summit_id":31,"class_name":"Presentation","allow_feedback":false,"avg_feedback_rate":0,"is_published":true,"head_count":0,"rsvp_link":null,"rsvp_template_id":0,"rsvp_max_user_number":0,"rsvp_max_user_wait_list_number":0,"rsvp_regular_count":0,"rsvp_wait_count":0,"rsvp_external":false,"meeting_url":"","attendance_count":0,"current_attendance_count":0,"image":null,"stream_thumbnail":"https://image.mux.com/SqsolWtPofrxL5xrXD8J51GI01wJusTl4uKlj4qQ6WYg/thumbnail.jpg","level":"Advanced","created_by_id":30966,"updated_by_id":27695,"show_sponsors":false,"creator_id":30966,"moderator_speaker_id":0,"selection_plan_id":18,"problem_addressed":null,"attendees_expected_learnt":"<p>  </p>\n<p>- What is a Life Cycle Assessment, why are they done and what are they used for</p>\n<p>- How to get started doing an LCA for cloud hardware in a large company/organization</p>\n<p>- Best practices</p>","to_record":true,"attending_media":false,"status":"Accepted","progress":"COMPLETE","selection_status":"accepted","disclaimer_accepted_date":1625106593,"disclaimer_accepted":true,"rank":2,"sponsors":[],"tags":[],"feedback":[],"current_attendance":[],"type":{"id":371,"created":1613066057,"last_edited":1613066057,"name":"Presentation","class_name":"PresentationType","color":"#f0f0ee","black_out_times":false,"use_sponsors":true,"are_sponsors_mandatory":false,"allows_attachment":false,"allows_level":true,"is_default":true,"summit_id":31,"max_speakers":3,"min_speakers":1,"max_moderators":1,"min_moderators":0,"use_speakers":true,"are_speakers_mandatory":true,"use_moderator":true,"is_moderator_mandatory":false,"moderator_label":"","should_be_available_on_cfp":true,"summit_documents":[20],"allowed_media_upload_types":[18,31]},"track":{"id":36004,"created":1624293851,"last_edited":1624293851,"name":"EW: 2021 Strategic Initiatives","description":"<p>This track includes all 2021 Strategic Initiatives.</p>\n<p>Sustainability and Test &amp; Validation</p>\n<p>There are 2 key work-streams being developed under this Strategic Initiative: Lifecycle of Systems/Components and Metrics.

These standards empower the Arm ecosystem to deliver an interoperable out-of-the-box experience across the market segments. For OCP compliant servers, this includes SystemReady SR (Servers) and LS (LinuxBoot Servers) certification bands. Ampere Computing is delivering successful products that align with Arm SystemReady, as well as the OSP OSF requirements. Ampere recently launched its 80-core Arm64 Altra processor on the Mt. Jade platform, which is the first system to achieve Arm SystemReady SR certification. In this presentation, we will highlight the Arm SystemReady program and the associated server design requirements and discuss development options to enable OSF compliant firmware on Arm servers.

However, the adoption of EDSFF in NVMe-oF is non-trivial. For instance, balancing of CPU resource allocation, memory scheduling, and network bandwidth management are challengeable. In this talk we will discuss the challenges and opportunities for adopting EDSFF in NVMe-oF both from hardware and software standpoint. Specifically, we will present two server architectures highly optimized for E1 and E3. In this context, we will present software stack for NVMe-oF solution that enables up to 400GbE performance over TCP network and manages large-scale capacity with low overhead. Finally, we will share the performance measurement methodology for systems equipped with large quantities of EDSFF NVMe SSDs and will share features of test suites which will help explore the potential use cases of NVMe-oF solution.</p>","social_description":"","start_date":1636585200,"end_date":1636586100,"summit_id":31,"class_name":"Presentation","allow_feedback":false,"avg_feedback_rate":0,"is_published":true,"head_count":0,"rsvp_link":null,"rsvp_template_id":0,"rsvp_max_user_number":0,"rsvp_max_user_wait_list_number":0,"rsvp_regular_count":0,"rsvp_wait_count":0,"rsvp_external":false,"meeting_url":"","attendance_count":0,"current_attendance_count":0,"image":null,"stream_thumbnail":"https://image.mux.com/LM01ZCJ35OkMTp5qMFbtWOsu02vl01VW7BzOYZWHyYGsPE/thumbnail.jpg","level":"Advanced","created_by_id":28114,"updated_by_id":27695,"show_sponsors":false,"creator_id":28114,"moderator_speaker_id":0,"selection_plan_id":18,"problem_addressed":null,"attendees_expected_learnt":"<p>The attendees can learn about the characteristics of the latest EDSFF form factor and its effectiveness.

SAI was open sourced in 2015, and over the years the API has grown in popularity and capabilities. Today, there are over 1500 attributes supported by SAI. The challenge now is to ensure that the intent of those attributes is consistently represented by various implementations. In this presentation we recognize the issue and bring forth an auto generated test framework that will help broaden test coverage for SAI. The proposed changes to the Packet Test framework will help community generate new tests and achieve a goal of getting 100% coverage of all objects and attributes. These changes are foundational to SONiC/SAI gaining broader acceptance and deployment in the

We will also discuss various mitigation options we are considering managing the impact of such memory corrected errors.</p>","social_description":"A case study of the memory corrected error profiling in a large scale cloud deployment","start_date":1636585800,"end_date":1636587300,"summit_id":31,"class_name":"Presentation","allow_feedback":false,"avg_feedback_rate":0,"is_published":true,"head_count":0,"rsvp_link":null,"rsvp_template_id":0,"rsvp_max_user_number":0,"rsvp_max_user_wait_list_number":0,"rsvp_regular_count":0,"rsvp_wait_count":0,"rsvp_external":false,"meeting_url":"","attendance_count":1,"current_attendance_count":0,"image":null,"stream_thumbnail":"https://image.mux.com/eBzMKVBZfmveJ4ZOsnv2vAfVUHA1VOAkNIUIqkH9sWA/thumbnail.jpg","level":"Advanced","created_by_id":28017,"updated_by_id":27695,"show_sponsors":false,"creator_id":28017,"moderator_speaker_id":0,"selection_plan_id":18,"problem_addressed":null,"attendees_expected_learnt":"<ul>\n  <li>What are the various types of memory corrected errors observed in a large scale cloud infrastructure</li>\n  <li>Not all memory corrected errors are created equally; some have larger blast radius vs others</li>\n  <li>How can we use this data to make better mitigation decisions and reduce the blast radius </li>\n</ul>","to_record":true,"attending_media":true,"status":"Accepted","progress":"COMPLETE","selection_status":"accepted","disclaimer_accepted_date":1626825234,"disclaimer_accepted":true,"rank":8,"sponsors":[{"id":5,"created":1594672447,"last_edited":1594672447,"name":"Meta","url":"","display_on_site":false,"featured":false,"city":"","state":"","country":"","description":"","industry":"","contributions":"","contact_email":"","member_level":"None","admin_email":"","overview":"","products":"","commitment":"","commitment_author":"","logo":"https://object-storage.public.mtl1.vexxhost.net/swift/v1/6e4619c416ff4bd19e1c087f27a43eea/assets-fn/companies/5/logos/OCP21GLO-SessionBrandingBar-Sponsor-Meta1.png","big_logo":"https://object-storage.public.mtl1.vexxhost.net/swift/v1/6e4619c416ff4bd19e1c087f27a43eea/assets-fn/companies/5/logos/OCP21GLO-SessionBrandingBar-Sponsor-Meta.png","color":"#f0f0ee","sponsorships":[1311,1307,1312,1310,1313,1721,1735,1736,1741,1772,1775,1776,1779,1782,1785,1786,1789,1791,1796,1829,1835,1839,1841,1847,1860,1864,1866,1870,1871,1873,1880,1901,1908,1913,1914,1921,1923,1931,1954,1962,1964,1992,2085,2093,2118,1956,2096,1665,1865],"project_sponsorships":[]}],"tags":[],"feedback":[],"current_attendance":[],"type":{"id":371,"created":1613066057,"last_edited":1613066057,"name":"Presentation","class_name":"PresentationType","color":"#f0f0ee","black_out_times":false,"use_sponsors":true,"are_sponsors_mandatory":false,"allows_attachment":false,"allows_level":true,"is_default":true,"summit_id":31,"max_speakers":3,"min_speakers":1,"max_moderators":1,"min_moderators":0,"use_speakers":true,"are_speakers_mandatory":true,"use_moderator":true,"is_moderator_mandatory":false,"moderator_label":"","should_be_available_on_cfp":true,"summit_documents":[20],"allowed_media_upload_types":[18,31]},"track":{"id":35989,"created":1618866603,"last_edited":1618866603,"name":"EW: Hardware Management","description":"<p>This project creates and designs specifications to enable interoperable manageability for Open Compute Platforms, with core focus on baseline hardware manageability and out of band management.</p>\n<p>Includes Sub-Projects: OpenRMC, Hardware Management Module, Hardware Fault Management</p>","code":"EW5","slug":"ew-hardware-management","session_count":20,"alternate_count":5,"lightning_count":0,"lightning_alternate_count":0,"voting_visible":false,"chair_visible":true,"summit_id":31,"color":"#fffd67","icon_url":null,"track_groups":[31,32],"allowed_tags":[60],"extra_questions":[],"selection_lists":[218,219,246,251,266,267,277,278,303,304,305,306,353,369,382,383,388,404,454,476,510],"allowed_access_levels":[{"id":96,"created":1627866697,"last_edited":1627866697,"name":"VIRTUAL-ALL","description":"Allows access to all areas of the virtual event","template_content":"","is_default":false,"summit_id":31}]},"location":{"id":219,"created":1613067195,"last_edited":1613067195,"name":"210AE","short_name":"","description":"<p>Executive Talks &amp; Engineering Workshops</p>","location_type":"Internal","order":11,"class_name":"SummitVenueRoom","capacity":300,"override_blackouts":false,"venue":{"id":209,"created":1613066436,"last_edited":1613066436,"name":"SJCC","short_name":"San Jose McEnery Convention Center","description":"<p>The San Jose McEnery Convention Center sits in the center of Downtown and boasts hundreds of varied events a year.

SoC node (7n --> 5n --> 3n..) is moving much faster than Power node. With load voltage reaching as low as 0.5V, the load current is reaching more than 1.5KA with peak current more than 2X-4X of that current. The second challenge is the Keep Out Zone required for any mechanical/thermal requirements which limits the area and height available for any VR component. The third challenge is the interfering between the high-speed signal and noise generated by any VR; this limits the area and layers used for routing any power signals. The fourth challenge is the space available on the back of the board due to the connector height and KOZ requirements. In addition, any VR solution should achieve the best performance/efficiency. This presentation will discuss these challenges in more details and put some recommendation for all power delivery designers and manufacturers.</p>","social_description":"OAM Power Delivery design challenges and recommendations","start_date":1636587000,"end_date":1636588200,"summit_id":31,"class_name":"Presentation","allow_feedback":false,"avg_feedback_rate":0,"is_published":true,"head_count":0,"rsvp_link":null,"rsvp_template_id":0,"rsvp_max_user_number":0,"rsvp_max_user_wait_list_number":0,"rsvp_regular_count":0,"rsvp_wait_count":0,"rsvp_external":false,"meeting_url":"","attendance_count":0,"current_attendance_count":0,"image":null,"stream_thumbnail":"https://image.mux.com/BqZB9rV02k6ESXzEJgDqgJUACgvDfjZ6L02TW1TKWCSQ00/thumbnail.jpg","level":"Advanced","created_by_id":31026,"updated_by_id":27695,"show_sponsors":false,"creator_id":31026,"moderator_speaker_id":0,"selection_plan_id":18,"problem_addressed":null,"attendees_expected_learnt":"<p>* OAM Power Delivery design Challenges</p>\n<p>* Power Delivery recommendation moving forward </p>\n<p><br /></p>","to_record":true,"attending_media":true,"status":"Accepted","progress":"COMPLETE","selection_status":"accepted","disclaimer_accepted_date":1626566689,"disclaimer_accepted":true,"rank":8,"sponsors":[{"id":1,"created":1579886208,"last_edited":1579886208,"name":"Intel Corporation","url":"","display_on_site":false,"featured":false,"city":"","state":"","country":"","description":"","industry":"","contributions":"","contact_email":"","member_level":"None","admin_email":"","overview":"","products":"","commitment":"","commitment_author":"","logo":"https://object-storage.public.mtl1.vexxhost.net/swift/v1/6e4619c416ff4bd19e1c087f27a43eea/assets-fn/companies/1/logos/OCP21GLO-SessionBrandingBar-Sponsor-Intel2.png","big_logo":"https://object-storage.public.mtl1.vexxhost.net/swift/v1/6e4619c416ff4bd19e1c087f27a43eea/assets-fn/companies/1/logos/OCP21GLO-SessionBrandingBar-Sponsor-Intel3.png","color":"#f0f0ee","sponsorships":[1376,1384,1400,1396,2339,2012,2259,1731,1745,1777,1798,1801,1835,1845,1848,1853,1860,1936,1948,1960,1961,1964,1993,2046,2085,2086,2098,2132,2115],"project_sponsorships":[]}],"tags":[],"feedback":[],"current_attendance":[],"type":{"id":371,"created":1613066057,"last_edited":1613066057,"name":"Presentation","class_name":"PresentationType","color":"#f0f0ee","black_out_times":false,"use_sponsors":true,"are_sponsors_mandatory":false,"allows_attachment":false,"allows_level":true,"is_default":true,"summit_id":31,"max_speakers":3,"min_speakers":1,"max_moderators":1,"min_moderators":0,"use_speakers":true,"are_speakers_mandatory":true,"use_moderator":true,"is_moderator_mandatory":false,"moderator_label":"","should_be_available_on_cfp":true,"summit_documents":[20],"allowed_media_upload_types":[18,31]},"track":{"id":35987,"created":1618866603,"last_edited":1618866603,"name":"EW: Server","description":"<p>Technologies and products for compute and hardware acceleration including but not limited to silicon, modularity, products and integration solutions.</p>\n<p>Includes Sub-Projects: OAI (Open Accelerator Infrastructure), ODSA (Open Domain-Specific Architecture), NIC/Mezz, HPC (High Performance Computing)</p>","code":"EW2","slug":"ew-server","session_count":41,"alternate_count":5,"lightning_count":0,"lightning_alternate_count":0,"voting_visible":true,"chair_visible":true,"summit_id":31,"color":"#ffeac2","icon_url":null,"track_groups":[31,32],"allowed_tags":[60],"extra_questions":[],"selection_lists":[214,215,249,272,273,279,287,288,297,307,328,351,367,386,402,440,452,465,471,511,512],"allowed_access_levels":[{"id":96,"created":1627866697,"last_edited":1627866697,"name":"VIRTUAL-ALL","description":"Allows access to all areas of the virtual event","template_content":"","is_default":false,"summit_id":31}]},"location":{"id":223,"created":1613067295,"last_edited":1613067295,"name":"211A-D","short_name":"","description":"<p>Engineering Workshops</p>","location_type":"Internal","order":15,"class_name":"SummitVenueRoom","capacity":300,"override_blackouts":false,"venue":{"id":209,"created":1613066436,"last_edited":1613066436,"name":"SJCC","short_name":"San Jose McEnery Convention Center","description":"<p>The San Jose McEnery Convention Center sits in the center of Downtown and boasts hundreds of varied events a year.

Native NVMe-oF is a new emerging drive technology that connects drives directly to the Ethernet network. By implementing the NVM Express standard NVMe over Fabrics (NVMe-oF) technology natively, storage drives enable growth of networked storage capacity and provide scalability. Finally, multi-port drives containing 25G/50G speeds allow for dis-aggregation and composition in Data Centers. </p>\n<p>This presentation will explore the functions and features of the storage device class referred to as Native NVMe-oF Drives and how they provide lower latency, enhanced performance and leverage various form factors like U.2 and the new EDSFF.

However conventional runtime RAS services are natively implemented as UEFI SMM modules can’t be directly integrated into coreboot framework. This talk provides technical solution for enabling runtime RAS services under coreboot framework via FSP API interface. By de-coupling RAS service from DXE stack, it is possible to deliver runtime RAS functionality via Standalone MM architecture and Intel® FSP with minimum bootloader changes. This concept implementation on OCP Yosemite V3/Cooper Lake Xeon SP processor will illustrate the technical feasibility with coreboot framework. This talk is part of Intel® FSP exploration to support diversified boot frameworks along with Open system firmware initiative, will cover Xeon runtime RAS overview, traditional runtime RAS in UEFI, Standalone MM architecture with FSP API for enabling runtime RAS in coreboot and working demo. </p>","social_description":"","start_date":1636589700,"end_date":1636590600,"summit_id":31,"class_name":"Presentation","allow_feedback":false,"avg_feedback_rate":0,"is_published":true,"head_count":0,"rsvp_link":null,"rsvp_template_id":0,"rsvp_max_user_number":0,"rsvp_max_user_wait_list_number":0,"rsvp_regular_count":0,"rsvp_wait_count":0,"rsvp_external":false,"meeting_url":"","attendance_count":0,"current_attendance_count":0,"image":null,"stream_thumbnail":"https://image.mux.com/IIUBF01ymOA01mKSGI01SsduL2CLtAKYUUUglqrDvIGlpk/thumbnail.jpg","level":"Intermediate","created_by_id":31010,"updated_by_id":27695,"show_sponsors":false,"creator_id":31010,"moderator_speaker_id":0,"selection_plan_id":18,"problem_addressed":null,"attendees_expected_learnt":"<p>The participant should learn UEFI Platform Initialization Architecture, Intel(R) Firmware Support Package Definition, Xeon RAS functionality and Coreboot framework.</p>","to_record":true,"attending_media":false,"status":"Accepted","progress":"COMPLETE","selection_status":"accepted","disclaimer_accepted_date":1626350639,"disclaimer_accepted":true,"rank":9,"sponsors":[{"id":1,"created":1579886208,"last_edited":1579886208,"name":"Intel Corporation","url":"","display_on_site":false,"featured":false,"city":"","state":"","country":"","description":"","industry":"","contributions":"","contact_email":"","member_level":"None","admin_email":"","overview":"","products":"","commitment":"","commitment_author":"","logo":"https://object-storage.public.mtl1.vexxhost.net/swift/v1/6e4619c416ff4bd19e1c087f27a43eea/assets-fn/companies/1/logos/OCP21GLO-SessionBrandingBar-Sponsor-Intel2.png","big_logo":"https://object-storage.public.mtl1.vexxhost.net/swift/v1/6e4619c416ff4bd19e1c087f27a43eea/assets-fn/companies/1/logos/OCP21GLO-SessionBrandingBar-Sponsor-Intel3.png","color":"#f0f0ee","sponsorships":[1376,1384,1400,1396,2339,2012,2259,1731,1745,1777,1798,1801,1835,1845,1848,1853,1860,1936,1948,1960,1961,1964,1993,2046,2085,2086,2098,2132,2115],"project_sponsorships":[]}],"tags":[],"feedback":[],"current_attendance":[],"type":{"id":371,"created":1613066057,"last_edited":1613066057,"name":"Presentation","class_name":"PresentationType","color":"#f0f0ee","black_out_times":false,"use_sponsors":true,"are_sponsors_mandatory":false,"allows_attachment":false,"allows_level":true,"is_default":true,"summit_id":31,"max_speakers":3,"min_speakers":1,"max_moderators":1,"min_moderators":0,"use_speakers":true,"are_speakers_mandatory":true,"use_moderator":true,"is_moderator_mandatory":false,"moderator_label":"","should_be_available_on_cfp":true,"summit_documents":[20],"allowed_media_upload_types":[18,31]},"track":{"id":35988,"created":1618866603,"last_edited":1618866603,"name":"EW: Open System Firmware (OSF)","description":"<p>An open firmware development project aiming to allow BIOS to be modified and shared by the owners.

It is a scalable and high bandwidth serial interface specially designed for the OCP DC-SCM use cases. It allows tunneling of multiple manageability interfaces between Host Platform Module and DC-SCM module over low pin count LVDS-based interface. The LTPI addresses shortcomings of Serial GPIO interface used in DC-SCM 1.0 by providing much lower latency for GPIO and a possibility to tunnel I2C, SMBus, UART, Data/Custom Channels. LTPI allowed for pinout optimizations and new capabilities addition in DC-SCM 2.0.

In the design of these data centers, simulation is helpful to anticipate harmonic emission problems and to determine appropriate solutions. Several alternatives exist for simulating harmonics. In some instances, the re-combinations of harmonics and the branch impedances are neglected, which lead to overly conservative and inaccurate results. On the other hand, when harmonics exceed practical limits, there is reduced efficiency, equipment overheating and failure, and/or utility penalties. This work presents a new and more accurate harmonic modeling method for data center emissions, which consists of capturing the effects of complex electronics impedances within the data center.</p>","social_description":"This work presents a novel harmonic modeling method for data center harmonic emissions.","start_date":1636590300,"end_date":1636591800,"summit_id":31,"class_name":"Presentation","allow_feedback":false,"avg_feedback_rate":0,"is_published":true,"head_count":0,"rsvp_link":null,"rsvp_template_id":0,"rsvp_max_user_number":0,"rsvp_max_user_wait_list_number":0,"rsvp_regular_count":0,"rsvp_wait_count":0,"rsvp_external":false,"meeting_url":"","attendance_count":0,"current_attendance_count":0,"image":null,"stream_thumbnail":"https://image.mux.com/jZ017SXzSl00F02rf3mqSu2pSm02l7pt6IlGfARjm4VpjRk/thumbnail.jpg","level":"Advanced","created_by_id":29993,"updated_by_id":27695,"show_sponsors":false,"creator_id":29993,"moderator_speaker_id":0,"selection_plan_id":18,"problem_addressed":null,"attendees_expected_learnt":"<p>Harmonic modeling methods to simulate and design data centers with more accuracy, in order to prevent costly last minute solutions and network operator penalties.</p>","to_record":true,"attending_media":false,"status":"Accepted","progress":"COMPLETE","selection_status":"accepted","disclaimer_accepted_date":1626821596,"disclaimer_accepted":true,"rank":8,"sponsors":[{"id":5,"created":1594672447,"last_edited":1594672447,"name":"Meta","url":"","display_on_site":false,"featured":false,"city":"","state":"","country":"","description":"","industry":"","contributions":"","contact_email":"","member_level":"None","admin_email":"","overview":"","products":"","commitment":"","commitment_author":"","logo":"https://object-storage.public.mtl1.vexxhost.net/swift/v1/6e4619c416ff4bd19e1c087f27a43eea/assets-fn/companies/5/logos/OCP21GLO-SessionBrandingBar-Sponsor-Meta1.png","big_logo":"https://object-storage.public.mtl1.vexxhost.net/swift/v1/6e4619c416ff4bd19e1c087f27a43eea/assets-fn/companies/5/logos/OCP21GLO-SessionBrandingBar-Sponsor-Meta.png","color":"#f0f0ee","sponsorships":[1311,1307,1312,1310,1313,1721,1735,1736,1741,1772,1775,1776,1779,1782,1785,1786,1789,1791,1796,1829,1835,1839,1841,1847,1860,1864,1866,1870,1871,1873,1880,1901,1908,1913,1914,1921,1923,1931,1954,1962,1964,1992,2085,2093,2118,1956,2096,1665,1865],"project_sponsorships":[]}],"tags":[],"feedback":[],"current_attendance":[],"type":{"id":371,"created":1613066057,"last_edited":1613066057,"name":"Presentation","class_name":"PresentationType","color":"#f0f0ee","black_out_times":false,"use_sponsors":true,"are_sponsors_mandatory":false,"allows_attachment":false,"allows_level":true,"is_default":true,"summit_id":31,"max_speakers":3,"min_speakers":1,"max_moderators":1,"min_moderators":0,"use_speakers":true,"are_speakers_mandatory":true,"use_moderator":true,"is_moderator_mandatory":false,"moderator_label":"","should_be_available_on_cfp":true,"summit_documents":[20],"allowed_media_upload_types":[18,31]},"track":{"id":36000,"created":1618866603,"last_edited":1618866603,"name":"EW: Data Center Facility (DCF)","description":"<p>Design, commissioning and operational practice of the data center, power and cooling infrastructure in support if IT equipment, DC infrastructure management.</p>\n<p>Includes Sub-Projects: Advanced Cooling Facilities (ACF), Operation Technology Security (OTS), Modular Data Center (MDC)</p>","code":"EW16","slug":"ew-data-center-facility-dcf","session_count":20,"alternate_count":5,"lightning_count":0,"lightning_alternate_count":0,"voting_visible":false,"chair_visible":true,"summit_id":31,"color":"#b296ff","icon_url":null,"track_groups":[31,32],"allowed_tags":[60],"extra_questions":[],"selection_lists":[238,239,261,299,300,327,332,362,377,398,414,445,460,506,518],"allowed_access_levels":[{"id":96,"created":1627866697,"last_edited":1627866697,"name":"VIRTUAL-ALL","description":"Allows access to all areas of the virtual event","template_content":"","is_default":false,"summit_id":31}]},"location":{"id":237,"created":1613067972,"last_edited":1613067972,"name":"LL20D","short_name":"","description":"<p>Symposium &amp; Engineering Workshop</p>","location_type":"Internal","order":29,"class_name":"SummitVenueRoom","capacity":200,"override_blackouts":false,"venue":{"id":209,"created":1613066436,"last_edited":1613066436,"name":"SJCC","short_name":"San Jose McEnery Convention Center","description":"<p>The San Jose McEnery Convention Center sits in the center of Downtown and boasts hundreds of varied events a year.

Given the scale of their deployment, Migration seemed like challenging task and there were stringent business requirements around High Availability and keeping the lights on during migration. EPFL, Broadcom and Juniper (Apstra) teams worked together to formulate a migration strategy that would meet these requirements. In this joint-presentation, Architects from the three companies involved will elaborate their migration strategy, some of the issues hit during validation process and how those issues were fixed. The presentation also aims to discuss some of the optimisations used to minimise the downtime and the role of automation in large scale deployments and migrations.</p>","social_description":"","start_date":1636590300,"end_date":1636591800,"summit_id":31,"class_name":"Presentation","allow_feedback":false,"avg_feedback_rate":0,"is_published":true,"head_count":0,"rsvp_link":null,"rsvp_template_id":0,"rsvp_max_user_number":0,"rsvp_max_user_wait_list_number":0,"rsvp_regular_count":0,"rsvp_wait_count":0,"rsvp_external":false,"meeting_url":"","attendance_count":0,"current_attendance_count":0,"image":null,"stream_thumbnail":"https://image.mux.com/nmK018oB4KNpqSx01VP81cFrYsntc3svk9NLveJ2fjLJM/thumbnail.jpg","level":"Intermediate","created_by_id":31001,"updated_by_id":27695,"show_sponsors":false,"creator_id":31001,"moderator_speaker_id":0,"selection_plan_id":18,"problem_addressed":null,"attendees_expected_learnt":"<p>Attendees will also learn about:</p>\n<p>· Why EPFL choose SONiC</p>\n<p>· EPFL’s Fabric Architecture</p>\n<p>· SONiC configuration suitable for Migration</p>\n<p>· AoS integration with SONiC and how it facilitates large scale migration</p>","to_record":true,"attending_media":true,"status":"Accepted","progress":"COMPLETE","selection_status":"accepted","disclaimer_accepted_date":1626971720,"disclaimer_accepted":true,"rank":14,"sponsors":[{"id":53,"created":1629874084,"last_edited":1629874084,"name":"Juniper Networks","url":"","display_on_site":false,"featured":false,"city":"","state":"","country":"","description":"","industry":"","contributions":"","contact_email":"","member_level":"None","admin_email":"","overview":"","products":"","commitment":"","commitment_author":"","logo":"https://object-storage.public.mtl1.vexxhost.net/swift/v1/6e4619c416ff4bd19e1c087f27a43eea/assets-fn/companies/53/logos/OCP21GLO-SessionBrandingBar-Sponsor-Juniper.png","big_logo":"https://object-storage.public.mtl1.vexxhost.net/swift/v1/6e4619c416ff4bd19e1c087f27a43eea/assets-fn/companies/53/logos/OCP21GLO-SessionBrandingBar-Sponsor-Juniper1.png","color":"#DADADA","sponsorships":[2312,1828],"project_sponsorships":[]}],"tags":[],"feedback":[],"current_attendance":[],"type":{"id":452,"created":1631296776,"last_edited":1631296776,"name":"Video Presentation","class_name":"PresentationType","color":"#f0f0ee","black_out_times":false,"use_sponsors":true,"are_sponsors_mandatory":false,"allows_attachment":false,"allows_level":true,"is_default":false,"summit_id":31,"max_speakers":5,"min_speakers":0,"max_moderators":3,"min_moderators":0,"use_speakers":true,"are_speakers_mandatory":false,"use_moderator":true,"is_moderator_mandatory":false,"moderator_label":"","should_be_available_on_cfp":true,"summit_documents":[20,22],"allowed_media_upload_types":[18,26,29,30,31]},"track":{"id":35993,"created":1618866603,"last_edited":1618866603,"name":"EW: Networking","description":"<p>Networking hardware and software deployed into data centers, telecom central offices and enterprise.</p>\n<p>Includes Sub-Projects: Enterprise Connectivity Solutions (ECS), Open Network Linux (ONL), Open Network Install Environment (ONIE), SONiC</p>","code":"EW9","slug":"ew-networking","session_count":24,"alternate_count":5,"lightning_count":0,"lightning_alternate_count":0,"voting_visible":false,"chair_visible":true,"summit_id":31,"color":"#b2f8f8","icon_url":null,"track_groups":[31,32],"allowed_tags":[60],"extra_questions":[],"selection_lists":[224,225,254,265,280,281,295,298,356,371,391,407,443,450,456,466,515,523],"allowed_access_levels":[{"id":96,"created":1627866697,"last_edited":1627866697,"name":"VIRTUAL-ALL","description":"Allows access to all areas of the virtual event","template_content":"","is_default":false,"summit_id":31}]},"location":{"id":235,"created":1613067937,"last_edited":1613067937,"name":"LL20BC","short_name":"","description":"<p>Symposium &amp; Engineering Workshop</p>","location_type":"Internal","order":27,"class_name":"SummitVenueRoom","capacity":200,"override_blackouts":false,"venue":{"id":209,"created":1613066436,"last_edited":1613066436,"name":"SJCC","short_name":"San Jose McEnery Convention Center","description":"<p>The San Jose McEnery Convention Center sits in the center of Downtown and boasts hundreds of varied events a year.

To demonstrate this, the LibreBMC project was created and is being run under the OpenPOWER Foundation. Taking advantage of OCP’s DC-SCM spec, Antmicro has created the first ever open source DC-SCM 1.0 modules with LibreBMC supported FPGAs.

During this Workshop, based on DC-SCM, we will go deeper in describing the ingredients for a datacenter-ready modular hardware system (DC-MHS) and a modular software architecture (Hyperstack) to form a datacenter-ready integrated system stack (DC-Stack).  This integrated system will serve Hyperscale, Enterprise, and Edge environments and will drive toward the requirements of another OCP Initiative called Cloud Service Model (CSM). </p>","social_description":"","start_date":1636591800,"end_date":1636593000,"summit_id":31,"class_name":"Presentation","allow_feedback":false,"avg_feedback_rate":0,"is_published":true,"head_count":0,"rsvp_link":null,"rsvp_template_id":0,"rsvp_max_user_number":0,"rsvp_max_user_wait_list_number":0,"rsvp_regular_count":0,"rsvp_wait_count":0,"rsvp_external":false,"meeting_url":"","attendance_count":2,"current_attendance_count":0,"image":null,"stream_thumbnail":"https://image.mux.com/BqZB9rV02k6ESXzEJgDqgJUACgvDfjZ6L02TW1TKWCSQ00/thumbnail.jpg","level":"Advanced","created_by_id":31008,"updated_by_id":27695,"show_sponsors":false,"creator_id":31008,"moderator_speaker_id":0,"selection_plan_id":18,"problem_addressed":null,"attendees_expected_learnt":"<p> </p>","to_record":true,"attending_media":true,"status":"Accepted","progress":"COMPLETE","selection_status":"unaccepted","disclaimer_accepted_date":1627358963,"disclaimer_accepted":true,"rank":0,"sponsors":[],"tags":[],"feedback":[],"current_attendance":[],"type":{"id":371,"created":1613066057,"last_edited":1613066057,"name":"Presentation","class_name":"PresentationType","color":"#f0f0ee","black_out_times":false,"use_sponsors":true,"are_sponsors_mandatory":false,"allows_attachment":false,"allows_level":true,"is_default":true,"summit_id":31,"max_speakers":3,"min_speakers":1,"max_moderators":1,"min_moderators":0,"use_speakers":true,"are_speakers_mandatory":true,"use_moderator":true,"is_moderator_mandatory":false,"moderator_label":"","should_be_available_on_cfp":true,"summit_documents":[20],"allowed_media_upload_types":[18,31]},"track":{"id":35987,"created":1618866603,"last_edited":1618866603,"name":"EW: Server","description":"<p>Technologies and products for compute and hardware acceleration including but not limited to silicon, modularity, products and integration solutions.</p>\n<p>Includes Sub-Projects: OAI (Open Accelerator Infrastructure), ODSA (Open Domain-Specific Architecture), NIC/Mezz, HPC (High Performance Computing)</p>","code":"EW2","slug":"ew-server","session_count":41,"alternate_count":5,"lightning_count":0,"lightning_alternate_count":0,"voting_visible":true,"chair_visible":true,"summit_id":31,"color":"#ffeac2","icon_url":null,"track_groups":[31,32],"allowed_tags":[60],"extra_questions":[],"selection_lists":[214,215,249,272,273,279,287,288,297,307,328,351,367,386,402,440,452,465,471,511,512],"allowed_access_levels":[{"id":96,"created":1627866697,"last_edited":1627866697,"name":"VIRTUAL-ALL","description":"Allows access to all areas of the virtual event","template_content":"","is_default":false,"summit_id":31}]},"location":{"id":223,"created":1613067295,"last_edited":1613067295,"name":"211A-D","short_name":"","description":"<p>Engineering Workshops</p>","location_type":"Internal","order":15,"class_name":"SummitVenueRoom","capacity":300,"override_blackouts":false,"venue":{"id":209,"created":1613066436,"last_edited":1613066436,"name":"SJCC","short_name":"San Jose McEnery Convention Center","description":"<p>The San Jose McEnery Convention Center sits in the center of Downtown and boasts hundreds of varied events a year.

It is a scalable and high bandwidth serial interface specially designed for the OCP DC-SCM use cases. It allows tunneling of multiple manageability interfaces between Host Platform Module and DC-SCM module over low pin count LVDS-based interface. The LTPI addresses shortcomings of Serial GPIO interface used in DC-SCM 1.0 by providing much lower latency for GPIO and a possibility to tunnel I2C, SMBus, UART, Data/Custom Channels. LTPI allowed for pinout optimizations and new capabilities addition in DC-SCM 2.0. In this presentation we will go through overview of the DC-SCM 2.0 LTPI specification and key concepts that were worked out by the DC-SCM 2.0 LTPI Workstream Group in 2021.</p>","social_description":"","start_date":1636593480,"end_date":1636593540,"summit_id":31,"class_name":"Presentation","allow_feedback":false,"avg_feedback_rate":0,"is_published":true,"head_count":0,"rsvp_link":null,"rsvp_template_id":0,"rsvp_max_user_number":0,"rsvp_max_user_wait_list_number":0,"rsvp_regular_count":0,"rsvp_wait_count":0,"rsvp_external":false,"meeting_url":"","attendance_count":2,"current_attendance_count":0,"image":null,"stream_thumbnail":"https://image.mux.com/IPOoA6Q00MjoleyLRUS565yXvw701VoWHoriK9jqsNG64/thumbnail.jpg","level":"N/A","created_by_id":27731,"updated_by_id":27695,"show_sponsors":false,"creator_id":27731,"moderator_speaker_id":0,"selection_plan_id":18,"problem_addressed":null,"attendees_expected_learnt":"","to_record":false,"attending_media":false,"status":"Accepted","progress":"COMPLETE","selection_status":"unaccepted","disclaimer_accepted_date":1634239647,"disclaimer_accepted":true,"rank":0,"sponsors":[{"id":1,"created":1579886208,"last_edited":1579886208,"name":"Intel Corporation","url":"","display_on_site":false,"featured":false,"city":"","state":"","country":"","description":"","industry":"","contributions":"","contact_email":"","member_level":"None","admin_email":"","overview":"","products":"","commitment":"","commitment_author":"","logo":"https://object-storage.public.mtl1.vexxhost.net/swift/v1/6e4619c416ff4bd19e1c087f27a43eea/assets-fn/companies/1/logos/OCP21GLO-SessionBrandingBar-Sponsor-Intel2.png","big_logo":"https://object-storage.public.mtl1.vexxhost.net/swift/v1/6e4619c416ff4bd19e1c087f27a43eea/assets-fn/companies/1/logos/OCP21GLO-SessionBrandingBar-Sponsor-Intel3.png","color":"#f0f0ee","sponsorships":[1376,1384,1400,1396,2339,2012,2259,1731,1745,1777,1798,1801,1835,1845,1848,1853,1860,1936,1948,1960,1961,1964,1993,2046,2085,2086,2098,2132,2115],"project_sponsorships":[]}],"tags":[],"feedback":[],"current_attendance":[],"type":{"id":452,"created":1631296776,"last_edited":1631296776,"name":"Video Presentation","class_name":"PresentationType","color":"#f0f0ee","black_out_times":false,"use_sponsors":true,"are_sponsors_mandatory":false,"allows_attachment":false,"allows_level":true,"is_default":false,"summit_id":31,"max_speakers":5,"min_speakers":0,"max_moderators":3,"min_moderators":0,"use_speakers":true,"are_speakers_mandatory":false,"use_moderator":true,"is_moderator_mandatory":false,"moderator_label":"","should_be_available_on_cfp":true,"summit_documents":[20,22],"allowed_media_upload_types":[18,26,29,30,31]},"track":{"id":35987,"created":1618866603,"last_edited":1618866603,"name":"EW: Server","description":"<p>Technologies and products for compute and hardware acceleration including but not limited to silicon, modularity, products and integration solutions.</p>\n<p>Includes Sub-Projects: OAI (Open Accelerator Infrastructure), ODSA (Open Domain-Specific Architecture), NIC/Mezz, HPC (High Performance Computing)</p>","code":"EW2","slug":"ew-server","session_count":41,"alternate_count":5,"lightning_count":0,"lightning_alternate_count":0,"voting_visible":true,"chair_visible":true,"summit_id":31,"color":"#ffeac2","icon_url":null,"track_groups":[31,32],"allowed_tags":[60],"extra_questions":[],"selection_lists":[214,215,249,272,273,279,287,288,297,307,328,351,367,386,402,440,452,465,471,511,512],"allowed_access_levels":[{"id":96,"created":1627866697,"last_edited":1627866697,"name":"VIRTUAL-ALL","description":"Allows access to all areas of the virtual event","template_content":"","is_default":false,"summit_id":31}]},"location":{"id":290,"created":1634841554,"last_edited":1634841554,"name":"On Demand","short_name":null,"description":"","location_type":"Internal","order":61,"class_name":"SummitVenueRoom","capacity":10000,"override_blackouts":true,"venue":{"id":262,"created":1628280773,"last_edited":1628280773,"name":"Virtual Only","short_name":"VO","description":"<p>Activities and Events only found on virtual website.&nbsp;</p>","location_type":"Internal","order":54,"class_name":"SummitVenue","address_1":"150 W San Carlos St","address_2":"","zip_code":"","city":"San Jose","state":"CA","country":"US","lng":"-121.8863286","lat":"37.3382082","website_url":"","display_on_site":false,"details_page":false,"location_message":"","is_main":false,"maps":[],"images":[],"rooms":[290],"floors":[38]},"floor":{"id":38,"created":1634841465,"last_edited":1634841465,"name":"Online Content","description":"","number":0,"venue_id":262,"image":null,"rooms":[290]}},"speakers":[{"id":27879,"created":1625072519,"last_edited":1625072519,"first_name":"Kasper","last_name":"Wszolek","title":"Principal Engineer","bio":"<p>Kasper is focused on manageability firmware and hardware solutions for servers.

This study provides the detailed comparison of QSFP, QSFPDD and OSFP form factors for system engineers to apply them in current and future designs.</p>\n<p> This presentation will compare DAC, ACC and AOC in multiple dimensions. First, design details will be introduced. The achievable reach distance for each cable type will be discussed.
